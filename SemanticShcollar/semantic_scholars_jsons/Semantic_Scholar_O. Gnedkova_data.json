        "abstract": "Every year there are new technologies used in the education of the younger generation. The introduction of mobile and portable devices in the educational process helps to improve the quality of educational materials by software. It complements or expands the content of textbooks and workbooks. The main trend in software development of educational purposes is the system of virtual and augmented reality. VR and AR-technologies provide an opportunity to interact with various branches of science, ranging from virtual excursions and object studies to experiments in Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Astronomy, etc. Virtual and augmented realities are unique learning environments in various fields of science reproducing virtual models in details. There are ready-made products designed for use in specific subject areas. Most software for learning in virtual and augmented reality have English language interface, so it’s a need to develop educational software for Ukrainianspeaking students and pupils.",

Due to rapid expansion, proliferation and increasing of functionality of mobile technologies we should use their potential to improve and facilitate learning, ensuring accessibility, equity, individualization and flexibility. The analysis of the basic features and benefits of mobile technologies for lifelong learning was conducted. The model using mobile learning technologies for learning English phonetics is proposed in the article. The mobile application allows organizing the learning process of English practical phonetics. This article describes the methodical implementation of the proposed model for learning of English phonetics. Modern education in many countries, including Ukraine, foresees the necessity of learning of foreign languages. The proposed mobile learning technologies help to achieve the main aim of learning foreign languages – forming the general and professional communicative competence of specialists in the",

        "abstract": "Research goals: determine particularities of using cloud services in English communicative competence forming process and develop the model of distance learning system (DLS) and cloud services interaction that improves the quality of the learning process. Research objectives: to identify, describe and develop methodological features of the model of distance learning system and cloud services interaction; consider on the examples the methods of use cloud services in DLS in foreign language training, aimed at English communicative competence forming process of students; experimentally investigate the level of using of cloud services in distance learning and identify ways of improving its use. Object of research: methodical system of foreign language students’ training of language faculties in high institutions. Subject of research: methodological model of the model of distance learning system and cloud services interaction in English communicative competence forming process. Research methods used: review and analysis of scientific publications, psychological, educational and instructional materials, modeling of complex systems, questionnaires, conducting pedagogical experiment. Results of research: The model of distance learning system and cloud services interaction was developed and the methodological particularities of this interaction are defined. Methods of using cloud services on the example of the distance course \"Practical English Course Upper Intermediate\" describing the methods of doing the tasks in English communicative competence forming process of language faculties were considered. As a result of experiment it was found there is a low level of use of cloud technologies in distance learning is a consequence of a lack of awareness of teachers in the possibilities of its use.",
