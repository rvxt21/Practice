        "abstract": "Under global competition, the training of personnel with the demanded competencies in the labor market becomes a guarantee ofcompetitive-ness of enterprises in the digital economy. The purpose of the paper is to identify gaps in the training of business analysts between the requirements of the labor market and the standards of higher education programs in Ukraine. Paper is devoted to analysis of the IT market of Ukraine and the imbalance of competences in the IT labor market in Ukraine; comparingthe requirements of employers for the competencies of IT specialists in the labor market; determiningthe competencies of educational programs in Ukraine according to the standards of the Ministryof Education and Science and their compliance with the requirements of the labor market for IT specialties,developingan experimental model of the impact of competencies of IT majors on the wages of business analysts.Affordablevacancies were analyzed and divided into 5 groups: Banks, Government institutions, IT, Retail and Other. These vacancies were analyzed by gen-eral competencies and specific subjectcompetencies.After comparing, the requirements of Ukrainian employers for the position of busi-ness analyst on the job search sites the most important specific subjectcompetencies for the IT industry were identified.Paper propose methodological approach to revise educational programmes according to market needs of employers.The ability to explain economic and social processes and phenomena based ontheoretical models, to analyze and interpret the obtained results, which determines the average monthly salary increase. The ability to develop business solutions and evaluate new technological proposals leads to a decrease in salary. The ability to form new competitive ideas and implement them in projects reduces the salary, when working inpositions in mature companies. Understanding flexible development processes increases the salary of employees.The proposed approachof reveal-ing statistical significant competences can be applied to any specialty",

        "title": "Intelligent System Control of the Vessel Executive Devices Redundant Structure",
        "abstract": "The article examines the issues of optimal control of vessels with redundant structures of executive devices on the example of an offshore vessel with two stern azimuth control devices (ACD) and a bow thruster. Known technical solutions for optimal control of redundant structures in the aviation, space, marine and other industries. The nearest technical solutions in the shipping are dynamic positioning systems (DP-systems) of manufacturers Navis, Marine Technologies, Rolls Royce, Transas, Consberg. The main purpose of such systems is to maintain the vessel in a given position with the help of active control during work (drilling, cable laying, cargo overloading, etc.). The main components of DP-systems are: sensors for measuring the absolute and relative position of the vessel (DGPS and Reference Systems), on-board computer with software and redundant structures of executive devices. Redundant structures in DP-systems are used to increase the reliability of the automated system. The article developed a method of using redundant structures also for optimization of control processes. The purpose of the work is to automate and optimize the processes of controling vessels with redundant structures of executive devices. On the example offshore vessel with two stern ACD and a bow thruster, optimal controls are considered that ensure: minimum energy consumption for performing DP operations, maximum control forces in the channels of longitudinal and lateral movement, which are used to move away from the platform in the presence of a downwind, as well as reconfiguration of redundant structures. The results of the experiment showed that the optimization of control processes allows to reduce energy consumption by (35–50) % and increase the control forces of the structure in the channels of longitudinal and lateral movement. At the same time, the additional load on the calculation cycle of the on-board controller, caused by the solution of optimization problems, is 25–50 ms, which is within (2.5–5) %.",

        "title": "Increasing Investment Portfolio Profitability with Computer Analysis Trading Strategies",
        "abstract": ". The paper is devoted to our research on the effectiveness of using different middle-and long-term trading strategies based on computer analysis (CA) indicators. This paper contains a brief overview of three technical analysis indicators that are usually used for getting buy or sell signals for some specific financial instruments (FIs). We have described the approach that allows using such signals not only for a single FI but for a whole investment portfolio. The initial investment portfolio is generated using Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory. The paper contains an overview of similar approaches presented by other researchers. During the experimental part of the research, we compared the effectiveness of using such CA indicators as moving average (MA), relative strength index (RSI), and support and resistance (S&R). The results prove that using certain CA strategies allows not only to increase the initial investment portfolio profitability on rising periods in the financial market but also may reduce loss during a global financial market recession.",

        "abstract": "The system for remote assessment of knowledge automates formation of task (tickets) with questions and tasks for conducting intermediate and final monitoring of knowledge of students is offered. In the process of developing an electronic system for knowledge assessment, the basic requirements for a web application and the modules that the system consists of were determined, the main roles of users in the system and their functionality were identified, access rights were established. The technical, functional, and non-functional features of the software product are described, web technologies for creating an application for knowledge assessment are considered. The diagram of system sequences, the use-case diagram, which schematically describing roles and functions of agents in an information system, the diagram of classes of a database structure are presented with UML description. Based on the defined requirements for the resource in cloud-based learning environment, the following technologies for its development were chosen: the server programming language PHP, JavaScript programming language and its libraries were used, as well as the MySQL database with PhpMyAdmin tool for administration of chosen database management system. OpenServer software complex system was used to develop and test the application functionality. The usage of the proposed electronic assessment system of knowledge contributes to the formation of an open information and cloud-based learning environment of a modern educational institution, enhances the efficiency and more rational distribution of teacher time in preparing tests or exams, activates repetition of educational material and knowledge assimilation, indirectly motivates students to more honest learning.",

        "abstract": "We have researched how machine-learning techniques can be applied in software tools for personal investment portfolio planning. This paper contains a brief overview of different types of machine learning algorithms and a description of the mathematical model used to build the optimal investment portfolio. The newly demanded and not implemented feature of Fintech software tools for personal investments (such as Robo-Advisor) is to forecast rates of financial instruments to quickly rebalance the structure of investment portfolio to increase potential income and decrease losses of investors. The price forecasting methods proposed in the paper can be used for this feature. During the experimental part of our research, we implemented a software tool that builds an optimal investment portfolio using price predictions created by LSTM neural network and linear regression method. The results were compared to a portfolio built using only historical data on financial instruments price. The research shows that using LSTM neural network forecasted values allows building better investment portfolios even during the global stock market recession.",

The development of the world is beginning to depend more on neighboring countries than on the global economy. State decision-making on the future trajectory of economic development requires a balanced quantitative analysis of the explanation factors that have the greatest impact on economic development in the \"new reality\". The purpose of the work is to study the influence of the spatial location of countries on the level of their economic development in a pandemic. The processes of convergence and divergence of development of countries in a pandemic are analyzed. Different spatial models of countries' development are compared in terms of macroeconomic efficiency indicators. An econometric model of spatial development of European countries for forecasting the pace of economic development has been developed.",

We compared their functionality, composed a list of critical features and described the high-level architectural design of a general robo-advisor tool, scope of application of robo-advisors, their key features, and a brief overview of existing solutions. Using Markowitz model, we set up a concept of a robo-advisor application for investors who have different attitudes towards risks. Our goal is to cover the main features of financial robo-advisor and to describe a high-level architecture for such applications. We have defined the main modules that represent the architecture of a typical robo-advisor. We also described different techniques, which could be applied for building a personalized investment and insurance portfolio.",

        "abstract": "The paper substantiates the need to study the level of financial security of an enterprise. To study the dynamics of financial security of an enterprise we consider a system-dynamic model and simulation of distributed financial flows of a representative industrial enterprise under the impact of random factors, which reflect the threats affecting its financial security. Information on the financial statements of firms is often confidential, which leads to the need to develop a simulation model of a firm’s activities and to conduct experimental research based on the enterprise’s size and reserve fund ensuring its financial security. During simulation experiments, three scenarios for metallurgical enterprise (pessimistic scenario, optimistic scenario and most probable scenario) were investigated, and it was established that for at least half of the cases, an enterprise needs to form a reserve fund to maintain autonomous operations and ensure the necessary level of financial security.

The paper aims to develop an integrated quality assurance infor-mation system to enhance institutional aspects of study programs at high ed-ucational institutes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop, at the uni-versity level, a standardized website structure designed to assure the quality of higher education with the identification of mandatory elements, for ex-ample, student survey results, rankings of students, lecturers staff, and edu-cational programs, results of verification of the uniqueness of scientific arti-cles and qualification works, review of educational programs for higher edu-cation applicants, e-library, electronic timetable, etc. This will allow us to unify approaches to electronic resource management and accelerate integrat-ing multi-level HEI elearning resources into a single portal. Paper presented developed quality assurance information system, which allows processing feedback of students for decision making of HEI's authorities.",

The generalization of recent publications had confirmed the relevance of the primary purpose of the paper. The domain analysis determined what tasks the decision support system should solve. The results of domain analysis became the base for the requirements specification. Logical and process views represent the system architecture design. A denormalized data structure, which accelerates the acquisition of aggregated data in different dimensions, is developed. The system design provides the work with various data sources as well as incremental development of the decision support system.",

        "abstract": "Our study demonstrates the introduction of a market-based mechanism for environmental management in conditions of a shortage of natural (water) resources. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of environmental externalities and technological progress on the stability of economic system development. We considered a model of upstream and downstream firms with production negative externality, taking into account that producer pollutant and farm enterprise are situated along the Ingulets river. Experimental data and OLS method were used in this model. The results of the study and practical recommendations will allow participants of the technological process to respond quickly to changes in the state of the environment and make effective decisions aimed at ensuring the stability of the economic system and environmental safety. We found that enterprise’s rate of technological development inspired by IT implementation has to be 0.28 times more than technological development of pollutant to save the stability of farm enterprise’s output.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose to use the Lean Methodology to reduce losses due to the uncertainty of possible solutions during the execution of a process that results in a valuable product. According to the Lean principle of amplify learning, risk management is implemented using feedback from process participants in short time intervals. Each such interval is represented by a cycle with stages build-measure-learn; the reaction of process participants in the learning stage improves the build stage in the next iteration. We propose to perform a hierarchical decomposition of risks and introduce two categories of risks: final risk, which corresponds to losses due to uncertainty in the outcome of decisions, and indicated risk, which means the deviation of process characteristics from the planned normative values. Two types of characteristics are considered: observable characteristics, that can be directly measured when the increment is reached, and unobservable characteristics related to consumers’ perception of the increment and can be evaluated through surveys. The mechanism for evaluating individual characteristics of the process iteration, aggregating the critical values for all characteristics, and obtaining the indicated risk level based on them is proposed. Options for determining the final risks based on the obtained levels of indicated risks are proposed.",

        "abstract": "Efficient human resource management needs accurate assessment and representation of available competences as well as effective mapping of required competences for specific jobs and positions. Thus, definition and identification of competence gaps express differences between acquired and required competences using a mathematical approach to support accurate competence analytics. Lack of skills and insufficient qualifications of employees are cited as major barriers to the adoption of new technologies in the context of Industry 4.0. These changes require skills for data analytics tasks. The purpose of this paper is to investigate gaps in the preparing of a business analyst between the requirements of the labor market and the standards of study programs. For the IT and other industries, the most important competencies from study program of Ukrainian High Educational Institutes, which correspond to labor market requirements, were revealed using RStudio.",

        "abstract": "The article discusses the issues of mathematical support of the Information and Risk Control System for the offshore vessel operating in high risk areas near oil or gas platforms, other large moving objects. Vessels operating in high-risk areas are equipped with dynamic positioning systems and excessive control, which allows to increase the reliability, maneuverability and quality of control. Minimally excessive control structure with two stern Azimuth Control Devices (ACD) is considered. This structure is the last “frontier” to provide three-dimensional vessel control, therefore it is interesting in practical use. The control surfaces for this structure were built, their extreme values and level lines were analyzed. To dispensation redundancy, three control splitting algorithms were considered, analytical expressions for control splitting were obtained. There was carried out a comparative analysis of the considered splitting algorithms between themselves and the prototype according to the minimum Risk criterion. A comparative analysis showed that the splitting algorithm used in the prototype are special cases of the considered algorithms for dispensation redundancy. There were found controls that provide a “clean” rotation of the vessel without lateral force, which are not present in prototype. There were built control algorithms that provide complex vessel movements according to the minimum Risk criterion in automatic mode. Operability and efficiency of the algorithmic and software of the vessel control system operating in high risk areas, verified by mathematical modeling at imitation modeling stand.",

        "abstract": "As the Chair of 2019 6th International Conference on Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing (ICMMM 2019), I would like to say it is my honor to have been involved with this excellent and exciting conference. Mechanical, materials and manufacturing are three disciplines that are all link directly. A conference that allows this latitude allows for research was success and the edge of knowledge can be pushed fully. This conference was no exception and I would like to thank the prestigious professors that supported the conference and presentations. Many conferences claim to be international, very few are. In Boston, there were delegates for north and south America, Europe, Africa, middle east, Indian region, South Korea and China. This joining of worldwide researchers allowed for an excellent conference. Furthermore, posters were of a high quality in keeping with the selection process of the work. Conferences need reviewers, and a thank you to all ours that supplied excellent feedback to maintain our standards. The level of presentation was as I expected, first class. These proceedings are to show the work and depth of research. We hope these will be the seminal work for larger research projects and cited as deserved. Finally, if you are reading and find interesting, submit a paper for next year, if you presented this year return and help us grow to deliver the support these disciplines deserved. Warmest regards, Professor Ian R. McAndrew PhD FRAeS ICMMM 2019 Conference Chair",

        "abstract": "The choice between economic efficiency and social equity has become a key objection in economic development, since in the current economic system, which has become close to the Pareto optimum, the achievement of both of these goals is mutually exclusive. Further balancing between these goals is possible only with a fundamental change of current system of economic relations and getting access to new curves of production capabilities, which may become quite real within development of Industry 4.0 and 6th technological wave. Nevertheless, nobody can predict the social impact of Industry 4.0 on society, which in the context of future technological changes transforms into Society 4.0. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a cluster analysis of countries inequality due to IT development. We researched impact of gross capital formation, research and development expenditure to create innovations, intellectual property and high-technology exports on inequality of countries using principal component analysis based on open data for 2012 – 2015. 2 main clusters of 45 countries were identified which have convergence and divergence attributes due to IT development. It was also revealed the countries with inequalities in ensuring economic efficiency and social equity due to other reasons which are not connected with IT development.",

        "abstract": "During making decision the logit and probit patterns serve to resolve different issues based on statistical data regarding expediency or inappropriateness: opening LTD, investing funds, hiring employees, entering a new market, introducing innovations, etc. The purpose of the research is to support the decision making in economic experiments using software tools and logit and probit analysis. To achieve this goal, the following tasks are defined: investigation of the range of application of the logit and probit models; calculation of open data using the RStudio; development of decision support models using open data sources. Methods and technologies of research: logit and probit models to predict the probability of dealing between traders of cryptocurrencies, cluster analysis of investor profiles through principal component analysis. To distinguish different types of investors we can use cluster analysis which help us to reveal main types of risk-attitude investors. After that we can construct correspondence between specific users and financial instruments.",

        "abstract": "Research goal of the paper is to study ecosystem usi ng Geographical Information System (GIS) based technology to develo p valid recommendations for sand extraction from water body. Our subject of research is GIS Based Model of Quotas Regulation and its Impact on the Ext raction of Ecosystems’ Natural Resources and Social Welfare. We used such m et ods as optimization methods, GIS methods, differential-equations method , marginal benefit-cost analysis. An example of mathematical model for dete rmining of ecological equilibrium during sand extracting in the ecosystem is developed using Google Maps. The influence of economic activity due to san d extraction on fish fauna is described. The GIS based ecological-economic mod el is developed on the logistic model basis for establishing regional quot as for extraction of natural resources during economic activity in the southern Ukraine. Regulatory economic mechanism of natural environment is propos ed. It implies such quota for sand extraction from water body, which does not lead to deterioration of the natural environment and stimulate the increase in s ocial welfare.",

        "abstract": "The paper analyses the variety of supermarkets’ strategies (imitation and innovation) through economic experiment under which sales and prices will adapt to market demand. We compared strategies of supermarkets to demonstrate the advantages of supermarkets’ strategy for imi tators and innovators under different conditions. Our proposed algorithm for competitive supermarket model with fuzzy demand can be employed as a competitive strategy in a microeconomic system in which a wide range of different products/services are sold through supermarkets. We reveal the profitability of imitation strategy increases in the long-run period. With a small number of supermarkets (two or three), the innovative strategy of supermarkets turns out to be more beneficial. The number of supermarkets, number of steps and average price of products has a positive impact on the profit of supermarkets of both types.",

The purpose of this paper is to d escribe data analysis of private investment decision making using developed too l of robo-advisers in longrun period. We considered consumption-saving ratio in economics, emerging trends of robo-advice (RA) services for making inves tment decisions. SWOTanalysis of robo-advice services and comparative ch aracteristics of roboadvisers explain advantage of RA services. We also developed mathematical model of robo-advisor in a long-run period and desc ribed support of investment decision making in long-run period via software mod ule of robo-advisor. The task assignment of developed IT service is to maint ain a constant level of client’s consumption during life-long period through a utomated analysis of how much he/she has to consume and save each year. Resul ts of consumption and savings proposals can be modified if initial financ i l data changes.",

        "abstract": "This paper is a sequel to our previous works related to Robo-advisors and cryptocurrencies. Our goal now is to build two application modules for a single Robo-advisor. The first module is a Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network which forecasts cryptocurrencies prices daily. The second module uses Robo-advising approach to build an investment plan for novice cryptocurrencies investors with different risk attitude investment decisions. The third module does ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) for a statistics dataset and neural networks models. Results of the investigation show that investing in cryptocurrencies can give 23.7% per year for risk-averse, 31.8% per year for risk-seeking investors and 16.5% annually for riskneutral investors.",

        "abstract": "The onrush of information technology raises the task of revising curricula of specialties in computer science. The objectives of the study are to define the requirements and develop a model of the curriculum revision system in computer science. Subject of research: curriculum revision system in computer science. Research methods: review and analysis of scientific publications, modeling of complex systems, questionnaires, expert method of evaluation. The model of the revision system of the curriculum is built taking into account the modern requirements of employers to the competence of university graduates in computer sciences. The architecture of this system is built on the basis of research on the functionality of such elements as the Top Competences (required in the labor market), Employers' Requirements, Learning outcomes (expected results of teachers) and the formation of the ICT curriculum. The expert method is used to assess the quality of the revision model of the curriculum on the example of a specialty in the field of computer science. Results of the research: the requirements of the labor market to the competence of university graduates were investigated, systematized and formulated in the field of computer science. These requirements are the basis for the formation of a new or improvement of the existing curriculum at the university.",

Object of research: microeconomics system with heterogeneous agents. Subject of research: mathematical model of microeconomic system with different social responsibilities, equilibrium and disequilibrium states of the systems using desktop application. Research methods are: optimization methods, bifurcation analysis, s tability analysis, simulation methods, game theoretic approa ch. Results of the research: dynamic models of microeconomic system with different social responsibilities (reciprocator and selfish types) were created using specially developed desktop application. Base d on software module the conditions of stability, bifurcation and analysis w ere obtained. As a result of numerical investigation we have found that flip bif urcations occur with increasing of firms’ number in the market. If two-t hirds of firms use naive expectation, then there appears the state of dynami c chaos.",

Subject of research: design, development and use of decision support s ystems in the study of economic disciplines in higher educ ation. Research methods used: comparative analysis, business analytics, de ign of software module, interactive decision making, analy tical methods. Results of the research: The quality of a decision depends on the input in formation and a set of relevant economic indicators. Dec ision making support systems with calculation algorithms containing endogen ous economic indicators, as well as the precedent knowledge base are designe d to facilitate selection of alternatives in decision making using exogenous par ameters. Automation of economic indicators’ calculations has a didactic pu rpose for students of economic specialties. The DSS developed will facilitat e decision-making in semistructured and unstructured situations at micro and macro levels.",

        "abstract": "This paper analyzes the dynamic interaction between selfish and reciprocity firms in the market of homogeneous product. The decisions of both types of firms in respect of their output strategies are investigated under naive, adaptive and generalized expectations. The standard postulate for competitive firms’ model has been extended by the assumption that there is a share of reciprocity firms which, unlike selfish firms, maximize both private and social benefits as consumer surplus. It has been proved that the unique Nash equilibrium is stable for all affordable values of parameters in the model with adaptive expectations, and is unstable for the model with naive expectations at sufficiently large number of firms in the market. A special desktop application has been created for animation of model trajectory and demonstration of stable quantity trajectories and bifurcation diagrams of firms’ output. Naive expectations of two-thirds of firms result in a state of dynamic chaos in the market leading to degeneration of the existing competition model between the two types of firms. The crucial factor which ensures the stable equilibrium in the market and the ability to predict firms’ output is the adaptive approach which takes into account the adaptive expectations of firms planning their product quantity.",

In this paper we use evolutionary algorithm (EA) to improve investment strategies in economic system comparing shares of most profitable investors with other ones. Proposed algorithm selects an optimal combination of investment share in different industries for improving of investment performance. In our experiment we use statistical data from official sources to examine effectiveness of proposed investment strategy. We find the investment strategies using evolutionary algorithm to teach investors how to increase their profit as much as possible and obtain more profit than investor with best start possibilities.",

        "abstract": "The paper deals with different approaches to the definition of ecommerce, including special mechanisms for the distribution of goods and payments, such as auction model. Different formats of auctions that change welfare of their participants are investigated. Software modules were developed for researching the effectivenes of double electronic Vickrey auction. It is defined that in double Vickrey auction incentives for most buyers and sellers are created to reveal their true types. The developed software module of double Vickrey auction showed the highest efficiency in the terms of social welfare among alternative formats and disproved the ability of Vickrey auction to achieve results like market mechanism of perfect competition.",
