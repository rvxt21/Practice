        "title": "Distance learning expert and leader",
        "abstract": ". The paper deals with the theoretical foundations of training experts and leaders of distance learning in order to improve their training program. An expert is a specialist who has an experience in developing distance courses, conducting distance learning classes and has and uses the skills of a content curator. Leaders create the conditions for innovative changes that allow people and organizations to share their vision and move in its direction, contribute to the management and implementation of ideas. The paper describes the basic skills to be developed by an expert and a leader, provides typical mistakes of distance course developers. Training of experts and leaders was based on the distance course “Distance Course Examination” for experienced developers of distance learning courses and administrators of distance learning systems from diﬀerent organizations. During the training, students analyzed the purpose of learning according to the Bloom’s taxonomy and its accessibility, the complexity of the text and its design, tasks and learning activities, test quality and evaluation system as well as other elements responsible for the quality of learning. During the pilot training, the results were obtained in the form of reports of students about the examination of the distance course as well as analysis of this work was done. 47 teachers of educational institutions of Ukraine were trained and only 12 teachers successfully completed their training. Based on the results of training and taking into account the experience of emergency training during the pandemic and military actions in Ukraine, the course program has been reﬁned. It is planned to use a team of experts, “playing” coaches and new methods for conducting distance learning. Particular attention is paid to training experts, leaders and measuring their competencies.",

        "abstract": "The article deals with the theoretical foundations of carrying out distance course (DC) examination with the aim of creating the program for expert training. An expert is defined as a specialist who has experience in compiling distance courses, organization of distance learning as well as has and uses content tutor skills.The article also describes the basic skills that an expert should have as well as typical mistakes of the developers of distance courses are presented. On the basis of the research a DC ``Expert examination of distance course'' was compiled for experienced developers of distance courses and administrators of distance learning systems at different institutions. During the training, the learners analyzed the purpose of Bloom's taxonomy and its accessibility, the complexity of the text and its design, the tasks and learning activities, the quality of tests and the evaluation system, etc. The result of the course training is learner's report on the distance course examination and analysis of this work. 47 lecturers of Ukrainian educational institutions were trained and only 12 of them successfully completed the training.",

        "abstract": "The world wide pandemic situation revealed the problems in all spheres of human life which haven’t been faced before. Recently the world has changed greatly as well as the relationship between people and their professional activity. The great bunch of the workload, if basically acceptable, is done with the use of modern innovative technologies. Such problems have not trampled down the sphere of higher education as well. Distance learning, which was previously addressed to only as accompanying possibility of lessons conduct, nowadays is considered to be the only practicable form of conducting lectures, practical lessons, tests, i.e. it has become a usual daily practice for both teachers and students. Among the basic functional requirements to the electronic educational resources in the system of distance learning there are the visualization and interaction principles both when getting familiar with the theoretical material and when completing virtual laboratory and practical tasks. The Microsoft Office documents have become the most widespread elements among the electronic educational resources. That is why there is a pressing need in presenting the electronic MS Excel spreadsheets on the resource web-pages. The simple and convenient way to solve the problem of Excel documents introduction into the electronic resources of the distance learning systems is the use of cloud services. The services help to acquire the access to the information resources of any level and of any capacity with the possibility to allocate the rights of the users belonging to different groups in relation to the resources. For that purpose the availability of the Internet network access and web-browser would be enough \\cite{Kravtsova2020}. The cloud calculation technologies introduction allows for the use of the programs that do not require special licensing, update versions monitoring and eliminates the need of software technical support as the provider himself exercises control over the functioning, data saving, antivirus protection and possible cyberassaults.The peculiarities of professional training of navigators require the students to acquire the knowledge of professionally-oriented tasks algorithms as well as the knowledge of technologies that can help to implements them. One of the main routines the officer needs to deal with on the navigational bridge is the use of the information systems of shipboard hardware. But before usage he needs to assure of the systems reliability. That is why it is extremely important to gain during the course of professional training the necessary skills of navigation equipment exploitation reliability assessment by means of Microsoft Office documents and cloud services. So the subject matter of the suggested research is the procedure development for the navigation equipment exploitation reliability assessment by means of modern services use in the course of professional training of future seafarers. The aim of the paper is the solution of the problems of optimum assessment of the information systems of shipboard hardware reliability by means of cloud technologies usage. The following tasks are completed in the course of the research: the peculiarities and characteristics of navigational information processed by the shipboard navigation and information system have been analyzed; the results of the information systems of shipboard hardware usage have been studied; the technological diagram of the basic components structuring of the “Information systems of shipboard hardware” complex for the Master’s degree training course has been created; the effective technology of the program Excel documents processing has been chosen; the system of access and usage of web-services for calculation tables processing in the system of distance learning has been designed;the process of competency formation which will enable students to use cloud services has been suggested.",

        "abstract": "The article is devoted to the problem, approaches, and features of usage of augmented reality applications in Japanese language learning for future language teachers. We analyzed the usage of augmented reality for supporting and organizing Japanese language learning for future Japanese language teachers and identification of the main approaches to the usage of augmented reality in Japanese language learning. It is concluded that augmented reality tools provide a new paradigm of teaching materials, which has a positive impact on the formation of basic and professional competencies of future Japanese language teachers; it can be effective when used in blended learning that combines distance, online, traditional, and self-directed learning of Oriental languages. Prospects for further research is the creation of guidelines for the usage of augmented reality tools for teaching Oriental languages at different levels of the training of future Oriental languages teachers.",

        "abstract": "The goal of knowledge quality improving of secondary school students in the field of exact sciences determines the relevance of creating interactive electronic educational resources for tasks solving of mathematical models programming. The paper presents the electronic textbook description, its content and structure, model, as well as design and software development technology. It is intended to improve qualitatively the preparation of high school students and junior university students in mathematics and programming. In particular, it can be used as a textbook at elective classes and young programmers’ clubs, as well as in the process of individual work to train schoolchildren and students for programming Olympiads. The content of the electronic textbook is based on a set of mathematical tasks. Each task contains a statement of the task, instructions for its solution and an algorithm for solving it, implemented in the form of program code in Pascal, C/C+ and Python. The model of learning system using an electronic training manual is described. The e-tutorial software is a Web application and is built on client-server architecture. The basis of the Webapplication is the \"Textbook\" software module, which contains a complex of mathematical tasks with the author's algorithms of solving. The web application contains a software module for expanding the electronic textbook content in the form of a built-in editor for mathematical tasks. A qualified user of the system has the opportunity to develop new tasks within the existing textbook format with a description of the algorithm for their solution. The automatic system of checking the proposed algorithm for task solving provides the basis for an expert opinion on placing a new task in the library for further use. The approbation of the Web-application in the educational process was carried out in secondary educational institutions of Kherson, and it received a positive assessment from students and teachers.",

        "abstract": "AR-technologies can be widely used in the educational process using ICT. Especially valuable is the use of AR-based applications for the visualization of illustrations of models of objects and processes in school books. The use of electronic educational resources using AR-technologies can improve the quality of students' knowledge, as well as provide teachers with a wide range of new opportunities. Using AR technology allows you to design and create effective learning resources. This develops students' creative thinking and increases their motivation to learn. In this paper, we consider a model of a learning system using augmented reality technologies for visualizing illustrations in school textbooks. A survey of secondary school teachers showed the possibility, interest and effectiveness of using e-learning tools based on AR technology. Pupils can use this electronic resource both in class at school and at home during independent study. Students of Kherson State University, interviewed in the STEM education system, showed a willingness to work with augmented reality technologies. To assess the prospects of using AR-based applications in the educational process, an expert method was used. Experts evaluated the prospects of using AR technology to visualize 2D and 3D models of educational objects. For evaluation, a five-point Likert system was chosen. The developed model can be used as a means to create the basis for future research, development and dissemination in the system of educational institutions. The proposed model of the learning system was tested in the classrooms of students in the learning process at STEM.",

        "title": "New effective aid for teaching technology subjects: 3D spherical panoramas joined with virtual reality",
        "abstract": "Rapid development of modern technology and its increasing complexity make high demands to the quality of training of its users. Among others, an important class is vehicles, both civil and military. In the teaching of associated subjects, the accepted hierarchy of teaching aids includes common visual aids (posters, videos, scale models etc.) on the first stage, followed by simulators ranging in complexity, and finished at real vehicles. It allows achieving some balance between cost and efficiency by partial replacement of more expensive and elaborated aids with the less expensive ones. However, the analysis of teaching experience in the Military Institute of Armored Forces of National Technical University “Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute” (Institute) reveals that the balance is still suboptimal, and the present teaching aids are still not enough to allow efficient teaching. This fact raises the problem of extending the range of available teaching aids for vehicle-related subjects, which is the aim of the work. Benefiting from the modern information and visualization technologies, we present a new teaching aid that constitutes a spherical (360° or 3D) photographic panorama and a Virtual Reality (VR) device. The nature of the aid, its potential applications, limitations and benefits in comparison to the common aids are discussed. The proposed aid is shown to be cost-effective and is proved to increase efficiency of training, according to the results of a teaching experiment that was carried out in the Institute. For the implementation, a tight collaboration between the Institute and an IT company “Innovative Distance Learning Systems Limited” was established. A series of panoramas, which are already available, and its planned expansions are presented. The authors conclude that the proposed aid may significantly improve the cost-efficiency balance of teaching a range of technology subjects.",

        "abstract": "The widespread use of distance learning platforms and office services, in particular spreadsheets, sets the task of their integration, for example, for using Excel documents in distance learning systems (DLS). Using cloud services can be a technological solution to this problem. The advantage of using cloud services is access to information resources using only an Internet connection and a web browser. The aim of the study is the development and implementation of the ExcelReader software module for using Excel spreadsheets on the web pages of the distance learning system. The following tasks were solved in the work: 1) analyzed well-known software solutions for displaying Excel documents in web applications and training platforms; 2) an effective technology for programmatically processing Excel documents was selected; 3) a model of a system for accessing and using web services for processing Excel documents in DLS was developed; 4) the ExcelReader software module was developed for displaying and editing Excel documents on web pages in the distance learning system; 5) The program module \"ExcelReader\" is implemented in DLS \"Moodle KMA\" and \"Kherson Virtual University\" (KVU). In particular, the ExcelReader software module was introduced into the educational process for using Excel spreadsheets on the web pages in DLS KVU using the Microsoft Excel Web App cloud service.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents an approach to building a system for testing procedural physical knowledge, i.e. knowledge of basic physical laws and the ability to use them. This approach consists of constructing mathematical models for each academic module in a physics course. The main constructive objects are test templates, which are mathematical models of test tasks, based on physical models of systems, processes and phenomena. The template of the class of physical tests for checking knowledge of the physical laws and abilities of transformations of a physical system is represented by a set of geometric drawings, diagrams, graphs of functional dependencies, a system of formulas for transforming physical values, templates of scenarios for changing the states of a physical system and a response template. Each such template can be used both in generating similarity algorithms for specific multiple tests, and in algorithms for automatically checking the correctness of answers. The proposed method allows describing a relatively simple class of specific tests. An important feature of the system is the ability to automatically check not only the final answer, but also the parameters of the intermediate states of the physical system. The implementation of a procedural physical knowledge testing system can be performed by creating software interactive multimedia objects using the methods of computer mathematics and algebraic programming technology.",

The introduction of mobile and portable devices in the educational process helps to improve the quality of educational materials by software. It complements or expands the content of textbooks and workbooks. The main trend in software development of educational purposes is the system of virtual and augmented reality. VR and AR-technologies provide an opportunity to interact with various branches of science, ranging from virtual excursions and object studies to experiments in Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Astronomy, etc. Virtual and augmented realities are unique learning environments in various fields of science reproducing virtual models in details. There are ready-made products designed for use in specific subject areas. Most software for learning in virtual and augmented reality have English language interface, so it’s a need to develop educational software for Ukrainianspeaking students and pupils.",

        "abstract": "The onrush of information technology raises the task of revising curricula of specialties in computer science. The objectives of the study are to define the requirements and develop a model of the curriculum revision system in computer science. Subject of research: curriculum revision system in computer science. Research methods: review and analysis of scientific publications, modeling of complex systems, questionnaires, expert method of evaluation. The model of the revision system of the curriculum is built taking into account the modern requirements of employers to the competence of university graduates in computer sciences. The architecture of this system is built on the basis of research on the functionality of such elements as the Top Competences (required in the labor market), Employers' Requirements, Learning outcomes (expected results of teachers) and the formation of the ICT curriculum. The expert method is used to assess the quality of the revision model of the curriculum on the example of a specialty in the field of computer science. Results of the research: the requirements of the labor market to the competence of university graduates were investigated, systematized and formulated in the field of computer science. These requirements are the basis for the formation of a new or improvement of the existing curriculum at the university.",

The results of modeling the quality management system of electronic educational resources (EER) on the basis of the analysis of its elements are presented. The subject of the study is the EER quality monitoring. Technologies for EER quality monitoring are based on the method of expert evaluations. The criterion of EER quality is considered as the weighted average value of quality indicators. The weights of EER types and indicators of EER quality for their types are evaluated in pedagogical experiment. Results of experiment confirmed the assumption that the method of expert evaluations can be the basis for the EER quality monitoring. Concordance method is used to assess the degree of consensus of experts on the factors: weights of EER types, parameterization of EER quality indicators, and weighted average criterion of EER quality. The model of quality management system is shown in the example of assessing the quality of the distance learning system resources.",

Active components of new subject, which are the most evident in a learning process, are analyzed in the article. The requirement block of information and communication environment as a subject of the educational process is described. The comparative characteristic of the main components of traditional and innovative teaching systems is presented in the article. The authors have made a comparative description of the main forms of university studies in different didactic models: object-subject, subject-subject and three-subject training. The measurement of cogency of each of these three study subjects and their significance in the process of major educational operations (collection, processing, storage, transmission) in various forms of training: lectures, practical classes and individual work were presented.",
