        "title": "Intelligent System Control of the Vessel Executive Devices Redundant Structure",
        "abstract": "The article examines the issues of optimal control of vessels with redundant structures of executive devices on the example of an offshore vessel with two stern azimuth control devices (ACD) and a bow thruster. Known technical solutions for optimal control of redundant structures in the aviation, space, marine and other industries. The nearest technical solutions in the shipping are dynamic positioning systems (DP-systems) of manufacturers Navis, Marine Technologies, Rolls Royce, Transas, Consberg. The main purpose of such systems is to maintain the vessel in a given position with the help of active control during work (drilling, cable laying, cargo overloading, etc.). The main components of DP-systems are: sensors for measuring the absolute and relative position of the vessel (DGPS and Reference Systems), on-board computer with software and redundant structures of executive devices. Redundant structures in DP-systems are used to increase the reliability of the automated system. The article developed a method of using redundant structures also for optimization of control processes. The purpose of the work is to automate and optimize the processes of controling vessels with redundant structures of executive devices. On the example offshore vessel with two stern ACD and a bow thruster, optimal controls are considered that ensure: minimum energy consumption for performing DP operations, maximum control forces in the channels of longitudinal and lateral movement, which are used to move away from the platform in the presence of a downwind, as well as reconfiguration of redundant structures. The results of the experiment showed that the optimization of control processes allows to reduce energy consumption by (35–50) % and increase the control forces of the structure in the channels of longitudinal and lateral movement. At the same time, the additional load on the calculation cycle of the on-board controller, caused by the solution of optimization problems, is 25–50 ms, which is within (2.5–5) %.",

The results of the study are based on a critical analysis of the tools and processes of functioning of marketing systems in the context of digitalisation, and the changes it causes in marketing systems at basic and extended levels due to specific features inherent in the digital economy. The concept of cultural dimensions by Hofstede (2010) is applied to determine the collective behavioural characteristics of the most numerous stakeholders of social marketing, which are members of society in selected countries. A positive statistically significant correlation between the share of online shoppers against the indulgence index (R=.77) and the individualism index (R=.73) was found. There is a negative statistically significant correlation between the share of online shoppers against uncertainty avoidance (R=-.76), power distance (R=-.67), gender culture type (R=-.27) and long-term orientation (R=-.27). In general, a significant part of the expected impact of uncertainty avoidance is taken over by mechanisms that guarantee the protection of personal data from unauthorised use and security from fraud and crime committed in cyberspace.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the article is to study the mental states factors of primary school pupils’ anxiety during the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The psychological factors of school anxiety and fears are theoretically substantiated. The methodological starting points of the empirical study are distinguished. The combination of psychological and physiological semantic parameters of the phenomenon is taken into account. Valid psychodiagnostic methods were used. The structure of mental states of pupils’ anxiety, which consisted of five main factors F1-F5 (∑D = 76.371; V = 20.005), was studied by factor analysis of ANOVA. It is established that the principal is the mental state F1 “School anxiety” (D = 38.029; V = 9.962), which is interrelated with the mental state F4 “Self-realization anxiety” (D = 9.711; V = 2.544) (rs=-.443; p≤.01) and the mental state F2 “Emotional-expressive anxiety” (D=16.057; V=4.206) (rs=.373; p≤.01). It was established and grounded that the mental state F5 “Isolation-physiological anxiety” (D=4.529; V=1.186) is suicidal. It is generalized that the obtained empirical results and theoretical substantiations will promote: realization of the decision of educational problems in primary school age; implementation of the obtained results in preventive and corrective-developmental work; will reduce anxiety and affect the formation of adequate behavior of fourth-graders of secondary education.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The issues of automatic vessel control in a storm are considered in the paper. Vessel control in a storm is the most difficult stage in the vessel’s wiring, as it requires quick decisions to be made in difficult conditions. Practical experience shows that the deterioration of the working conditions of the crew is usually associated with an increase in the number of control errors, which is completely unacceptable in stormy conditions. To assess the safe speed and course in a storm, Yu. V. Remez has proposed a universal storm diagram, which allows identifying unfavourable combinations of vessel speed and course angles of the waves – the resonant zones, and avoid them. The universal Remez diagram provides for graphical calculations, which, in combination with the visual determination of the wave parameters, gives a very low accuracy. The article examines the possibility of automatic control of a vessel in a storm by automatic measurement of motion parameters and wave parameters, automatic calculation in the onboard controller of the vessel optimal safe speed and course during a storm, automatic maintenance of the optimal safe speed and course of the vessel. The automatic control significantly increases the accuracy of calculations, excludes the human factor, reduces the depletion of the crew, and increases the reliability of the vessel control in a storm. The efficiency and effectiveness of the method, algorithmic and software were tested on Imitation Modelling Stand in a closed loop with mathematical vessel models of the navigation simulator Navi Trainer 5000.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the study is to perform comparative analysis of dominating psycho-emotional states of future specialists in a socionomic area under lockdown and martial law. A verification strategy is suggested for examining psycho-emotional states. The research used participant observation, valid and reliable psycho-diagnostic instruments, factor analysis, coefficients of empirical data reliability. It was established that in the comparison of the selected complex of psychological content parameters Group 1 (under lockdown) and Group 2 (under martial law) there are no significant differences. Two factor structures of the respondents’ psycho-emotional states were created: one of them – during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (59.91%) and the other – during the martial law (69.89%). It was found out that the obtained data on psycho-emotional states during the lockdown and the martial law are essentially different that did not allow determining or disproving significant differences by means of statistical coefficients. The study substantiated that the established empirical facts are characterized by scientific novelty which should be taken into consideration by organizers of educational and professional training for specialists in a socionomic area.",

Se da una visión moderna sobre el problema de la formación profesional de los psicólogos en las condiciones actuales de la reformación de la enseñanza. Se ha construido la matriz de correlación y la pléyade de correlación de las conexiones significativas entre las expectativas sociales y el coeficiente total de la preparación para la actividad innovadora. Se ha constatado que las conexiones más importantes son las positivas a nivel (p<.01): ESP (rs = .256), REA (rs = .171), IG (rs = .156) y CE (rs = .167). Se ha enfocado que la única conexión negativa con el locus-control sobre si mismo LSI (rs = -.099; p<.05) es la más peligrosa, ya que la excesiva autoconcentración influye de modo negativo en la innovación y la modernización de la esfera educativa. Se ha generalizado que es necesario trabajar con las expectativas de los sujetos del proceso educativo, ya que actúan como la proyección por la personalidad del modelo de la construcción del futuro y aseguran el resultado deseado.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the study is to determine the composition and functional significance of anticipatory resources in the process of temporal regulation of sensorimotor action. Materials and methods. The subjects were male (35 people) and female (31 people) students. The tasks of a simple sensory response, a choice reaction (three alternatives), and a “double choice” were implemented in a computer version of the experiment. In the “double choice” task, the stimulation variation was first provided (possible stimuli: one or three), and then a stimulus for a fast motor response was presented after some time, the orientation time (independent variable). Results. The participants’ initial reaction to the option with three alternative stimuli in the “double choice” task was negative. The time of the motor response falls linearly as the orientation time increases in both the male and female groups for the variant with one possible stimulus and the frequency of anticipatory effects and premature actions increases in a quadratic pattern. It must be noted that with enough orientation time, determining the expected duration of the sensorimotor action is quite straightforward. It was demonstrated that, in the presence of a margin of orientation time, operational estimates and revisions of the time required to accomplish an action dramatically improve the likelihood of anticipatory effects. Conclusions. Actualization of the anticipatory resource (which includes temporary memory standards, the ability to accurately determine and correlate the durations of processes and time intervals, time estimation skills, and individual characteristics that influence decision making) ensures the determination of the total duration of a sensorimotor action, prompt correction of its implementation, and a significant reduction in the time it takes to respond to a motor stimulus.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of the article is to study the training of a successful person in the colleges and universities of the USA as a holistic process and to create a structural and functional model. The methods of retrospective analysis, systematization and generalization, abstraction and specification, modeling and graphic visualization are applied. A structural and functional model of successful person training in colleges and universities of the USA has been created. The focus groups of this process have been defined, in which the work is aimed at applicants, first-year students, second-fourth years students and a special category - students of the last year and graduates, as a significant part of students do not complete their studies on time. Examples of effective use of models and strategies of student training by American institutions of higher education are given. Five stages of successful person training in American institutions of higher education are proposed. It is summarized that the created structural and functional model is the basis for creating a strategy for the development of an educational institution and will contribute to the high-quality organization of the training of specialists in colleges and universities.",

Materials and methods. The research was conducted as a psychological and pedagogical experiment. The following information technologies were used with the help of typhlo devices: “RUBY”; “SAPPHIRE”; “PEARL”; “TOPAZ”; “ONIX”; “SARA CE”; “PIEX TALK”; “TOUCH MEMO”; “FOCUS 40 BLUE”. Results. Significant differences in the use of typhlo devices with information technology were identified in the experimental and control groups (t=2.0-6.1; р<.01; р<.05): “RUBY”; “SAPPHIRE”; “PEARL”; “TOPAZ”; “SARA CE”; “PIEX TALK”; “FOCUS 40 BLUE”. The absence of significant differences was identified (t=1.5-1.6; р>.05): “ONIX”; “TOUCH MEMO”. It has been proved that implementing the recommended information technology increases interest in lessons, promotes cognitive activity, and enhances the school student’s creative potential. Conclusions. It was generalized that using typhlo devices during the work of school students with visual impairments allowed them to personalize their learning as much as possible, making the learning process creative and investigational.",

Se utilizó las herramientas de psicodiagnóstico que reflejaron de manera relevante el sujeto y el objeto de la investigación. Se interpretó cualitativamente los estados mentales dominantes de los encuestados, se aclaró el número óptimo de factores de la investigación y se describió las características semánticas psicológicas del fenómeno estudiado. El análisis factorial ANOVA permitió determinar la estructura de los estados mentales dominantes de los encuestados, que combina siete estados actuales (F1-F7), lo que constituye el 71.651% de la dispersión. El más importante de la estructura factorial es F4 “La Dominación pragmática”, que tiene más interrelaciones (n = 4) y la conexión más estable con F1 (rs=.333; p≤.01). Se argumentó que los parámetros psicológicos, la estructura y la interdependencia de factores son componentes clave para resolver las tareas de actividad táctica, de servicio, de fuego y de combate. Es conveniente poner en práctica los resultados del estudio durante la formación profesional y el entrenamiento táctico de los militares.",

        "abstract": "El objetivo del presente artículo es argumentar teóricamente e investigar empíricamente las orientaciones valorativas de los participantes del bullying en el espacio educativo. Se argumentaron teóricamente las características psicológicas del fenómeno del bullying tras las orientaciones valorativas de sus participantes. Como método, se describieron las bases metodológicas de la investigación empírica utilizando herramientas válidas de psicodiagnóstico. Se confirmó que todos los participantes del bullying, excepto sus observadores pasivos, tienen una orientación valorativa de “pasar bien el tiempo, descansar”, lo que evidencia la interrelación entre la “situación estresante” del bullying y el “agotamiento físico, moral” (p≤ .05). Para las víctimas y testigos que los ayudaban, la orientación valorativa predominante es la “ayuda y misericordia hacia los demás”, y para el acosador, “alto estatuto social” y “gobernar a la gente” (p≤.05). En conclusión, los resultados empíricos obtenidos y la argumentación teórica contribuyen a la operacionalización de la solución de tareas educativas en la escuela; la implementación de los resultados obtenidos en el trabajo preventivo, correccional de desarrollo reducirá la prevalencia y el nivel de efectos perjudiciales del bullying sobre los sujetos del espacio educativo influyendo en sus orientaciones valorativas.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of the article is empirical research and theoretical substantiation of subjective and dispositional vitality of representatives of parachuting and yoga practice; carrying out a comparative analysis of the results of two experimental groups with the control group. The analysis of probable causes of exhaustion and increasing of respondents’vitality has been carried out. The mechanisms of influence of the researched types of the activity of respondents at the level of subjective and dispositional vitality have been described. Participants of the research are: athletes of parachute sports JSC LLC “Avia-Soyuz” (Mayske, Dnipro, Ukraine)(n=43); representatives of yoga practice of the Yoga Studio “Symmetry” (Sumy, Ukraine) (n=36) and representatives of the control sample, which consisted of students of Kolomyia Educational Scientific Institute of the Precarpathian National University named after Vasyl Stefanyk (Kolomyia, Ukraine) and Kremenchuk Mykhailo Ostrohradskyi National University (Kremenchuk, Ukraine) (n=36). Methods. The following standardized and adapted psychodiagnostic techniques with experimental scales were used: “Subjective Vitality Scale”; “Hardiness Survey”. Results. Empirical results of the research of vitality and hardiness of respondents are presented. Significant correlations of the studied parameters have been established (p<.05; p <.01). Differences were set down in the parameter “Control” (p<.05) in the group of parachutists compared to the control. The high results of “Control” (M=22.12; SD=5.64) of representatives of parachuting have been substantiated with excessive danger and extremeness of this kind of sport. It is stated that total control can deplete parachutists, i. e. be a factor of reducing vitality. Emphasis was placed on the indicators of respondents who practice yoga, who had higher average values of Dispositional Vitality (M=35.64; SD=9.91) and Hardiness (M=57.81; SD=12.42) with lower average values of Control (M=19.12; SD=4.14). Conclusions. High level of subjective vitality as a state and dispositional vitality as a personal quality of parachutists and yoga was stated. Comparative analysis of the results with the indicators of the control group showed a direct dependence of the positive impact of parachuting and yoga practice on the respondents’ vitality and hardiness. It has been proposed to operationalize the results of the research in the practice of maintaining and improving the mental state of vitality of the representatives of the studied activities and to extend to athletes of individual and game sports.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the article was empirical research of the dominant psycho-emotional states of university lecturers during the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The article is devoted to an empirical study of the factor structure and the prevailing correlations between the psycho-emotional states of the respondents. Valid empirical methods with standardized questionnaires were used: the dominant coping strategy research method, the test of differentiation of emotional states, and the anxiety research method. The study’s empirical picture constructed. Psycho-emotional states were qualitatively interpreted, states were distinguished, and semantic psychological parameters were defined. The factor structure of the dominant psycho-emotional states of university lecturers was determined. The psycho-emotional state of F1 “Isolated activity”, which had the most intercorrelations and had the most significant (p≤.01) correlation with F4 “Pragmatic avoidance” (.344), was found to have the greatest factor load. It was empirically established and theoretically substantiated that the structure, variables, and interdependence of the factors of dominant psycho-emotional states were important components in solving issues of lecturers’ professional activity. It was noted that the findings may be useful for university administrations and pedagogical psychology researchers.",

        "abstract": "The aim is to conduct empirical research on the formation of reflective-evaluative competence in primary pupils with intellectual disabilities and to determine effective methods to develop it. Methods: tests with standardized questionnaires, methods for checking the logic of motivating dialogue, comparative analysis, quantitative and qualitative content-analysis. We established that disorders in the functioning of reflection in primary pupils are observed in changeable or unfamiliar situations: rejection to solve a problem, desire to simplify a task, justification of their inability, avoidance of difficulties. We registered that insufficient development of self-control and self-esteem causes faults in programming and performing activity. We identified difficulties in verbalizing a plan of actions showing the respondents’ inability to compare and substantiate practical and mental operations. Disorders in reflective-evaluative competence are insufficient development of reflection, self-control, self-esteem and self-correction that does not allow primary pupils to organize their mental actions purposefully.",

        "abstract": "The study partly reveals “Zelenskyi’s phenomenon”, when a person without any political experience confidently won a victory over an experienced politician at the presidential and parliamentary elections. The paper considered neuropsychological understanding of a brand as a multi-modal image with emotional connection and as an artificial addiction. Specific features of the perception of political slogans were studied with EMOTIV Epoc+ 14-channel mobile neurointerface and EmotivPRO and EMOTIV Brain Activity Map software. The ranking of slogans in terms of the efficiency of perception of the individuals of 40-60 years old was carried out on the basis of EEG and the cognitive and emotional indexes: obtained stress, interaction, interest, excitement, concentration, relaxation. The study involved 30 men and 30 women who intended to vote in the presidential elections of 2019. It was established which slogans are the best, good, average, ambiguous, with little effect, ineffective, with a negative effect. It was determined that the most effective and at the same time efficient slogan that evokes emotions and really encourages to support is PRESIDENT IS PEOPLE’S SERVANT. The best slogan that appeals to support it is “We Are Ukraine”, “New Policy of Ukraine”, “Country of Strong People!” The basic cognitive and emotional indexes that would contribute to the creation of effective psychological impact on voters’ behavior are the presence in the slogan of the word “Ukraine”, the avoidance of the so-called “stop words” (for women it is “army” and everything related to violence and death, and for men it is everything related to the provision of material benefits), the use of religious sentimentality in women and gender differences in slogans targeting. The value of the studied phenomenon and the efficiency of slogans and other media products before launching them into mass advertising has been proved.",

        "abstract": "The article researches of social expectations’ properties of future specialists of socionomic profile. Psycholinguistic determinants of personality construction of social reality are established. It is emphasized that the variability of the requirements of the social space necessitates constant prognostic activity of the life’s subject. This practice is demonstrated in relation to natural object connections, in the sphere of processes of social interaction, social communication and speech construction in the form of peculiar social expectations. Relevant psychodiagnostic research tools were used: clear quantification of texts, created a coding matrix, carried out quantitative and qualitative content analysis, empirical distribution of all levels’ scales of the studied parameters, Spearman correlation was determined. The predominant properties of the respondents were established: internality (n=18; 51.43%); activity (n=20; 57.13%), moderate openness results (n=16; 45.71%). It is proved that the respondents, interpreting the social field, pay considerable attention to the reflexive aspects, take the position of “participant in the process”. It is shown how sign-semantic formations, acquiring subjective meanings, become an objective fact that affects the construction of social reality by the individual. An example of content-analytical measurement of human behavior is demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "Context. The article proposes an approach for automated identification of the  navigators motivational model in the control of water transport. Algorithms for data extraction as a result of the man-machine interaction of navigator with the electronic control systems of the vessel during performing navigation operations of increased complexity are proposed. \nObjective. The purpose of research is to apply formal and algorithmic approaches to extracting data on the motivational model of navigator to prevent accidents in water transport.  \nMethod. The identification of manifestation determination of navigators’ mental activity by means of the visual concept of the geometric group theory is proposed. This approach delivered the visual systematic-logical combining of diagnostic methods aimed at determining navigators motivational centers and the processes of professional activity like maneuver performing. The key indicator of identification is said to be the parameter of the navigator’s activity as “rpm_port” having an impact on the vessel speed being a marker of intensification of the navigator’s physiological activity. Such an approach is beneficial in time phase identification while maneuvering indicating explicitly at the stepping up of the navigator’s physiological motivational state. It was proven to be correct based on the results due to Ward’s dendrogram, several statistical methods and applied software. The obtained research results encourage the prediction of the navigator’ motivational states in critical situations. \nResults. In order to confirm the proposed formal-algorithmic approach, an experiment was carried out using the navigation simulator Navi Trainer 5000. Automated analysis of experimental ones made it possible to form a motivational map of the navigator and determine the decision-making model affecting in the processes of  control vessel in difficult situations. \nConclusions. The proposed research approaches made it possible to automate the processes of extracting data indicating the principles of decision-making by navigator. The effectiveness of proposed approach was substantiated by the results of experimental data automated processing and the constructed tree-like decision-making spaces.",

The investigation contemplated methods are projective methods, psychodiagnostic methods with valid scales, author’s method “Indirect selfassessment of independence” (“ISI”) and the author’s questionnaire “Persuasion in independence” (“PII”). The results indicated that the most important for the respondents the value of independence, the more they are focused on taking into account the actual possibilities and autonomous action on the basis of objective data (ego-state “Adult”), as well as control, management, criticism of other people (ego-state “Parent-controller”). Therefore, the more autonomous respondents, the less interdependent they are, and vice versa.",

        "abstract": "The research is psychological-pedagogical experiment with factor analysis of value-sense meaningful parameters, preferences, expectations of future teachers (N = 140). The aim is to study the psychological rich in content features of formation of the value-sense sphere of future teachers. Values, while forming in the life experience of the individual, determinate the purpose-oriented and motivational program of behavior and provide sensory regulation of life activity. Personal sense, as a subject determinant, defines the effectiveness of professional activity. The development of system of values and senses is determined by rich in content process, the involvement of students in various types of social activities and purposeful impact by training facilities. Research methods: psychological and pedagogical experiment, standardized tests, factor analysis. The structure of value and sense regulation is determined. The forming stage provided changes in the experimental group (N = 17) from values oriented on social perception to values of personal and professional development. In the control group (N = 19), the dominance of personal comfort values was recorded. Compared to the ascertaining stage, the values of personal- professional development has emerged. The results obtained can be useful to stakeholders, leaders of educational institutions, researchers of self-regulation, axiogenesis, life creation and personality expectations.",

        "abstract": "Uncertainty and instability haunt us every day in today’s new reality. The purpose is a theoretical justification and empirical study of the hardiness of the personality in critical conditions of life. Psychodiagnostic complex of hardiness is indicated as a factor of personality adaptation. High average and high levels of hardiness are characteristics of an independently developed personality with a high ability to adapt. It has been established that the average level of hardiness contributes to the optimal experience of situations of uncertainty and involves a person’s choice of coping strategies to counteract the new difficulties in professional and personal life. It has been substantiated that respondents who have high rates of hardiness have a higher level of adaptation efficiency. It has been stated that “risk acceptance” as the component of hardiness of participants of the “Work and Travel” program is more pronounced than in the respondents of other samples (t = -1.54). It has been proved that empirical research of semantic psychological parameters of personality hardiness in critical conditions of life allowed to draw significant conclusions. It is noted that the results of the study need to be operationalized in training, educational and developmental and psycho-correctional practices. It is emphasized that the obtained empirical results should be used in the training of applicants for psychological specialties.",

        "abstract": "The research presents theoretical substantiation and correlation analysis of the factors causing emotional indifference in athletes with different levels of mastership, participating in individual and team sports (n = 180). The purpose is to carry out empirical research on athletes’ personality traits helping overcome mental exhaustion and prevent form emotional indifference. Research methods: correlation analysis, valid and reliable psycho-diagnostic instruments. The research was conducted during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and made it possible to find out a number of regularities. Results. The development of mental exhaustion in athletes is determined by a different level of manifestation of personality traits and their correlation in the structure of personality: anxiety, self-esteem, the level of aspirations, locus of control and motivation for achieving success and avoiding failures. The study shows that significant differences between the level of aspirations and self-esteem in the men (r = .38**), high anxiety in the men and women correlating with the integral index of mental exhaustion (r = .28**;r = 36**) mostly contribute to mental strain in many athletes. It finds out that the events of their personal lives become a factor of mental exhaustion provided that external locus of control prevails. This trait is pronounced in the athletes – Masters of team sports (r = .34**). The research determines that a low level of mental exhaustion in the athletes engaged in team sports is a consequence of the significance of social support (r =-.38**). High requirements for demonstrating success cause mental strain for the male athletes that increases probability of their mental exhaustion. Conclusions. The obtained results operationalize the process of solving the problems of professional training for athletes. Understanding the essence of mental exhaustion allows solving the problem of emotional indifference in athletes. Research on the role of emotional intelligence in the structure of athletes’ mental exhaustion is considereds to be very promising. © 2021, Editura Universitatii din Pitesti. All rights reserved.",

Se determinan los niveles de expectativas sociales del individuo. Se establecen las propiedades predominantes de las expectativas en la situación actual de la actividad educativa y profesional. La agrupación del conjunto de datos estudiados está fundamentada e implementada metodológicamente. Métodos de investigación: análisis de contenido, pruebas con cuestionarios estandarizados, análisis factorial, análisis de conglomerados por k-medias. Se da la estructura de tipos de expectativas sociales del individuo. La clave en esta estructura es el tipo de expectativas sociales entendidas activamente (n=34; 43.55%). Los resultados obtenidos son importantes conocimientos sociopsicológicos que hacen un aporte científico al fenómeno estudiado. Creemos que la aplicación de los conocimientos adquiridos en la práctica contribuirá a la organización eficaz del trabajo en las diversas esferas de la actividad humana. El conocimiento adquirido es de valor científico para todos los que estudian los patrones psicológicos de las expectativas sociales del individuo.",

        "abstract": "On the basis of empirical experimental data, relationships were identified indicating the influence of navigators' response to such vessel control indicators as maneuverability and safety. This formed a hypothesis about a non-random connection between the navigator's actions, response and parameters of maritime transport management.\nWithin the framework of this hypothesis, logical-formal approaches were proposed that allow using server data of both maritime simulators and operating vessels in order to timely identify the occurrence of a critical situation with possible catastrophic consequences.\nA method for processing navigation data based on the analysis of temporal zones is proposed, which made it possible to prevent manifestations of reduced efficiency of maritime transport management by 22.5 %. Based on cluster analysis and automated neural networks, it was possible to identify temporary vessel control fragments and classify them by the level of danger. At the same time, the neural network test error was only 3.1 %, and the learning error was 3.8 %, which ensures the high quality of simulation results.\nThe proposed approaches were tested using the Navi Trainer 5000 navigation simulator (Wärtsilä Corporation, Finland). The simulation of the system for identifying critical situations in maritime transport management made it possible to reduce the probability of catastrophic situations by 13.5 %. The use of automated artificial neural networks allowed defining critical situations in real time from the database of maritime transport management on the captain's bridge for an individual navigator.",

        "abstract": "Time synthesis of sensorimotor action is reviewed as a process of a coherence setting action duration (expected duration), time sequence of required operations and significant changes in conditions. Aim: to experimentally set up the connection of time synthesis success and efficiency of realization sensorimotor action in changeable conditions. Hypothesis: successful time synthesis of the setting duration and the temporal sequence of operations in the mental organization of sensorimotor action in changing conditions is realized in accordance with the corresponding operational meaning and is allowed by anticipatory effects and an increase in the effectiveness of the action, materials and methods. An experimental study involved 152 male and female students. Participants of the investigation solved experimental tasks, implemented in a computer version, according to schemes of a simple visual-motor reaction and a choice reaction (separately and in combination), according to a scheme of sensorimotor action with a warning signal when the apperceptive scheme, setting duration and sequence of required operations were changed promptly. Results were reviewed in the aspect of disclosing the features of the subject's elimination of the uncertainty of the moment of achieving the goal in the future and the construction of a sequence of operations of sensorimotor actions in a connection with changes in external conditions, typical for the time deficit regime. The conditionality of the time synthesis of sensorimotor action by the actual operational meaning was established revealing that the successful temporal synthesis of sensorimotor action in changing conditions is associated with the fastest acceptance of an adequate apperceptive scheme, with effective anticipation of the moment of achieving the goal and the formation of a detailed setting duration of action, with the formation of a temporal sequence of required operations. Conclusions. The levels of success of the time synthesis of sensorimotor action in changing conditions are highlighted: “quite successful; moderately successful; unsuccessful.”",

        "abstract": "Aim. The present study empirically investigates and theoretically substantiates the results of the impact of social media on young web-users’ psychological well-being during the forced self-isolation caused by the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 254). Materials and methods. Standardized valid psycho-diagnostic methods, the author’s questionnaire (A. Hudimova, 2021), correlation and factor analyses were used to identify young web users’ patterns of social media involvement during the forced self-isolation. Results. The results show that during the global COVID-19 pandemic, young web users give preference for passive social media use rather than for communication. The obtained results showed an expansion in the time spent via social media by young web users. It was found that the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by the participants’ experience of negative emotions and fears of the unknown (r = .204; p <.01). It is substantiated that increasing immersion of young web users in social media is a kind of strategy to escape from bad thoughts (r = .271; p <.01). Significantly, it is stated that uncontrolled use of social media causes sleep disorders during isolation (r = .444; p <.01). Conclusions. The study proves that young people spend almost all day online due to the obsessive pattern of social media involvement and/or procrastination, which often provokes withdrawal syndrome upon the attempt to distract from them. The lack of controlled time spending on social media during self-isolation provokes an exacerbation of anxiety, apathy, depressed mood, and a sense of isolation from social reality. The obtained results provide evidence that the causal relations of passive social media use provoke an exacerbation of feelings of alienation, disrupt the healthy rhythm of sleep, and psychological state of young web-users during the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "The aim is to theoretically substantiate and empirically study the psychological\n semantic parameters of conformism of adolescence and to establish the relationship with\n values. Value orientations as an important regulatory mechanism of personality behavior\n are revealed. Conformism is interpreted through social desirability as the individual’s\n desire for positive and constructive interaction, exchange with society, during which\n the individual obeys the latter, presenting himself in a favorable light. It is noted\n that young people often change their values under the pressure of “significant others”\n and society, presenting themselves in a favorable light, implementing conformal\n behavior. It is established that conformism correlates with value orientations\n (p<.01; p<.05). It is noted that respondents with a high level of conformism are\n characterized by a change in values under the influence of the environment and people\n with low levels – this trend is not observed. It has been studied that in adolescence\n there is a shift in the orientation of the individual from focusing on other people to\n focusing on their own meanings and values. It is determined that a person with a high\n level of conformism can neglect his own values, and therefore change his own behavior,\n which can be regarded as a “challenge to the environment”. It is offered to apply the\n received empirical results in training and to implement in educational and professional\n preparation of students-psychologists.",

        "abstract": "Taking into account current trends in the development of ergatic maritime transport systems, the factors of the navigator’s influence on vessel control processes were determined. Within the framework of the research hypothesis, to improve navigation safety, it is necessary to apply predictive data mining models and automated vessel control.\nThe paper proposes a diagram of the ergatic vessel control system and a model for identifying the influence of the navigator “human factor” during navigation. Within the framework of the model based on the principles of navigator decision trees, prediction by data mining means is applied, taking into account the identifiers of the occurrence of a critical situation. Based on the prediction results, a method for optimal vessel control in critical situations was developed, which is triggered at the nodes of the navigator decision tree, which reduces the likelihood of a critical impact on vessel control.\nThe proposed approaches were tested in the research laboratory “Development of decision support systems, ergatic and automated vessel control systems”. The use of the Navi Trainer 5,000 navigation simulator (Wartsila Corporation, Finland) and simulation of the navigation safety control system for critical situations have confirmed its effectiveness. As a result of testing, it was determined that the activation of the system allowed reducing the likelihood of critical situations by 18–54 %. In 11 % of cases, the system switched the vessel control processes to automatic mode and, as a result, reduced the risk of emergencies.\nThe use of automated data mining tools made it possible to neutralize the negative influence of the “human factor” of the navigator and to reduce the average maneuvering time during vessel navigation to 23 %",

        "title": "IDENTIFICATION OF MARINE EMERGENCY RESPONSE OF ELECTRONIC NAVIGATION OPERATOR",
        "abstract": "Context. The article introduces an approach for analyzing the reactions of a marine electronic navigation operator as well as automated identification of the likelihood of the negative impact of the human factors in ergatic control systems for sea transport. To meet the target algorithms for providing information referring to the results of human-machine interaction of an operator in marine emergency response situations while managing increasing complexity of navigation operations’ carrying out are put forward. Objective. The approach delivers conversion of the operator’s actions feature space into a logical-geometric one of p-adic systems making the level of the operator’s intellectual activity by using automated means highly likely to be identified. It is sure to contribute to its dynamic prediction for the sake of further marine emergency situations lessening. Method. Within the framework of the mentioned above approach attaining objective as automated identification of the segmented results of human-machine interactions a method for transforming deterministic fragments of an operator’s intellectual activity in terms of p-adic structures is proposed to be used. To cope with such principles as specification, generalization as well as transitions to different perception spaces of the navigation situation by the operator are said to be formally specified. Having been carried out of simulation modeling has turned out to confirm the feasibility of the proposed above approach causing, on the grounds of temporary identifiers, the individual structure of the operator’s reactions to be determined. As a result, the data obtained has delivered the possibility of having typical situations forecasted by using automated multicriteria methods and tools. This issue for its part is said to be spotted as identification of individual indicators of the operator’s reaction dynamics in complex man-machine interaction. Results. In order to have the proposed formal-algorithmic approach approved an experiment was performed using the navigation simulator Navi Trainer 5000 (NTPRO 5000). Automated analysis of experimental server and video data have furnished the means of deterministic operator actions identification in the form of metadata of the trajectory of his reactions within the space of p-adic structures. Thus, the results of modeling involving automated neural networks are sure to facilitate the time series of the intellectual activity of the electronic marine navigation operator to be identified and, therefore, to predict further reactions with a high degree of reliability. Conclusions. The proposed formal research approaches combined with the developed automated means as well as algorithmic and methodological suggestions brought closer to the objectives for solving the problem of automated identification of the negative impact of the human factors of the electronic navigation operator on a whole new level. The efficiency of the proposed approach is noticed to have been approved by the results of automated processing of experimental data and built forecasts.",

        "abstract": "The article considers the main characteristics of the types of tactical thinking of football players. The aim of the article is empirical research and theoretical substantiation the operational elements of tactical thinking of football players in the main game roles. Differences in the main indicators of tactical thinking of football players of different game roles have been determined. Participants of the research are: 72 football players were involved as subjects. The footballers represented four teams from different regions of Ukraine: “Naftovyk-Okhtyrka” Football Club (Okhtyrka, Ukraine), “TSK Agribusiness” Football Club (Romny, Ukraine), “Romny” Football Club (Romny, Ukraine), “Crystal Football Club” (Kherson, Ukraine). The following psychodiagnostic techniques with experimental scales were used: “Study of the profile of athletes’ thinking”, “Prediction ability” by L. Regush. Empirical results of the research of tactical thinking are presented. According to the results of empirical research, we can state there are significant differences between the answers of football players of different game roles. The level of tactical thinking of attackers is much higher than that of other players. Defenders differ significantly from goalkeepers by more pronounced general predictability (t = 2.08) and flexibility (t = 4.51); from attackers by less analyticity (t = 2.72) and flexibility (t = 2.61). Midfielders have significantly more developed awareness (t = 2.76) and profoundness (t = 4.85) than goalkeepers, but, at the same time, less developed than the attacker’s analyticity (t = 5.05), flexibility (t = 5.2), profoundness t = 5.2) and prospectiveness (t = 2.67). The attackers are significantly ahead of the defenders by the indicators of analyticity (t = 2.72) and flexibility (t = 2.61). Attackers and goalkeepers differ the most among the studied game roles, namely concerning general predictability (t = 3.28), analyticity (t = 5.67), flexibility (t = 5.26) and prospectiveness (t = 3.07). It has been found that the level of manifestation of the main properties of tactical thinking of defense is significantly lower than in other game roles.",

        "abstract": "Social media have an ambivalent effect on the physical activity of young athletes. The purpose is to establish the relationship between young athletes’ psychological disorders through the excessive use of social media. The main task was to analyze whether there is a deviation from training, which increases time spent on social media. Research methods. The study is based on the results of anonymous valid psychodiagnostic tools submitted to Google Forms and statistical analysis. Physical activity of young athletes (N = 110) aged 16 to 21 years was assessed on the scales of diagnostic tests, parameters of physical activity, time spent online, feelings of loneliness, and sleep disorders due to excessive use of social media during the global pandemic. Results. It was found that during quarantine, young athletes prefer to displace bad thoughts and distract from training for spending too much time on social media applications (rs = .202; p ≤ .05). It was stated that young athletes experience negative emotions due to the situation with the coronavirus, which leads to the increased time spent on social media, which is a kind of coping strategy (rs = .340; p ≤ .01). As a result of uncontrolled use of social media and reduced parameters of physical activity, competitive performance during the lockdown, young athletes face sleep disorders (rs = .277; p ≤ .01) and manifestations of depression (rs = .430; p ≤ .01). Conclusions. It is empirically established and theoretically substantiated that there are causal links to excessive use of social media due to reduced parameters of physical activity. The decreased physical activity provokes an exacerbation of loneliness, training regimen, and recovery. It is noted that the “mask of the active user” encourages manifestations of depression, displacement of feelings, and problems, which leads to a decrease in the psychological well-being of young athletes.",

        "abstract": "Aim. The aim of the study is to perform psychological and psychophysiological analysis of the features of stress resistance that provide adaptation of medical personnel in the situation of uncertainty. Materials and methods. The study involved: 125 students of III and IV years of study majoring in “Treatment” and “Nursing”; 95 internship doctors 2-3 years of training in various specializations. 36.84% of the total numbers of studied internship doctors were those whose specialization is characterized by an increased level of stress. Methods: correlation analysis, tests with standardized questionnaires. Result. It was found that the manifestation of open, direct aggression by respondents is an acceptable strategy of interaction, which does not significantly affect adaptability. It has been studied that hostility, as an internal directive of the personality, is often not observed externally and determines the decrease in emotional comfort and violation of adaptation. Conclusions. It is proved that adaptive activity as a system-forming factor is accompanied by a number of psychological, biological and social processes and collectively forms the stress resistance of the personality. It is indicated that the immune system is an important part of the functional systems that form the biological factor of functional diagnosis at the stage of low stress resistance and borderline disorders. It is noted that it is appropriate to use functional diagnosis as a basis for diagnosing a person’s mental state in the development of stress resistance.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of the study is a theoretical substantiation and empirical study of the psychological content parameters of the relationship between perfectionism and feelings of loneliness in youth. A new view of modern reality with its constant changes and increased requirements for the functioning of the individual in society has been substantiated. It is noted that such a view provokes the mass formation and spread of perfectionism and loneliness. It is noted that every day more and more people, especially young people, suffer from the imperfections of this world and the feeling of isolation from others. It has been established that socially conditioned perfectionism, concern for mistakes, doubts about one’s own actions and self-criticism have a positive significant connection with the feeling of loneliness in youth (p<.01). However, rigid perfectionism and self-centered perfectionism are inversely related to feelings of loneliness. It was found that young men are largely prone to self-centered perfectionism (p<.01). A pronounced high level of loneliness was observed in n=18 subjects. Attention has been drawn to the fact that doubts about one’s own actions and concern for mistakes inevitably provoke feelings of loneliness. Emphasis has been placed on important areas of actualization of empirical results in order to develop constructive perfectionism. It has been noted that the results obtained should be operationalized in educational and professional training of students-psychologists.",

        "abstract": "Informatization of Ukrainian higher education institutions is a priority of the state educational policy, one of the directions of improving HEI's IT infra-structure. The paper aims to develop an integrated quality assurance infor-mation system to enhance institutional aspects of study programs at high ed-ucational institutes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop, at the uni-versity level, a standardized website structure designed to assure the quality of higher education with the identification of mandatory elements, for ex-ample, student survey results, rankings of students, lecturers staff, and edu-cational programs, results of verification of the uniqueness of scientific arti-cles and qualification works, review of educational programs for higher edu-cation applicants, e-library, electronic timetable, etc. This will allow us to unify approaches to electronic resource management and accelerate integrat-ing multi-level HEI elearning resources into a single portal. Paper presented developed quality assurance information system, which allows processing feedback of students for decision making of HEI's authorities.",

The purpose is to determine the characteristics of self-efficacy of future athletes with different levels of psychological safety. An empirical study was conducted in a sample of students of the faculty of physical education and sports. The following psychodiagnostic methods were used: “Psychological safety of the educational environment” (I. A. Baeva, 2011), “World Assumptions Scale” (R. Janoff-Bulman, 1989), “Generalized self-efficacy scale” (R. Schwarzer, M. Jerusalem, 1992; adapted by V. Romeka, 1996). Results.The correlation between the level of general self-efficacy and the parameters of psychological security is established. This is, first, with the parameters of psychological security of the educational environment that affect self-rating, self-esteem (р < .05); second, with satisfaction with the level and quality of interpersonal relationships with mentors and other participants (р < .05). It is proved that the indicators of psychological safety of the individual, specifically, which are related to the awareness of their ability to control the events of the world, i.e. the level of self-control, and are interrelated with the level of general self-efficacy. It is proposed to optimize the parameters of psychological safety, which will increase the level of self-efficacy of athletes in the following aspects: 1) Development of readiness for psychologically safe interaction between the subjects of the educational process (motivational aspect); 2) Modeling of psychologically safe educational environment at the university (organizational aspect); 3) Development of communicative competence as the ability to communicate effectively (communicative aspect); 4) Creating conditions that are aimed at self-realization of personal resources, maintaining a positive image of “Self” (self-rating aspect). The obtained results can be operationalized in the psychological and tactical training of future athletes.",

        "abstract": "Contemporary marine education tends to have been using navigation simulators enabling cadets to be trained for any unlikely event. These issues are sure to be in the sector with high demand focusing on safety. Thus, they would be extremely beneficial for marine industry. The proposed study aims to identify seafarer fatigue during the maneuver carrying out according to circumstantial evidence and, as a result, the influence of this phenomenon on the trajectory formation of transition or maneuver experiences. In addition to it, the method of cadet posture identification is generally revealed. To summarize all this information exo – back spine and an automated system are proposed to be used. The study provides the mechanism formation of spatial trajectory taking into account the identification of fatigue indicators. This issue will, eventually, benefit into reducing risks of accidents. Besides, a formal description of perception and decision-making processes being performed by the cadet by means of modal logic and algebra of events are introduced in the preceding article. It is a basis for determining the stages and individual preferences in the formation of the trajectory transition (maneuver). To make ground, the experiment within the framework of analyses of the mooring operation carrying out is sure to be named an effective one. This article proposes comprehensive approaches and provides the possibility to classify models for the formation of the trajectory of the cadet in conditions of fatigue crack factors.",

        "abstract": "The purpose is to determine the value attitudes of student youth to physical culture and sports and its influence on the quality of volitional self-regulation of behavior and aspiration for success. An empirical study was conducted among students who are not majoring in physical education. Psychodiagnostic techniques have been applied: original questionnaire to find out the level of students’ physical and sports activity; the method of “Style of self-regulation of behavior” (Morosanova & Konoz, 2000); “The need for achievement” test-questionnaire (Orlov, 1998). Results. A statistically significant interconnection was established between the parameters of self-regulation of one’s behavior, namely: “Planning”, “Evaluation of results”, “Flexibility”, “Independence”, and the need for success among student youth (p < .01). The correlation between the level of students’ physical and sports activity and their aspiration for success was established (p < .01). Differences between groups of students with high and low levels of physical and sports activity by the variables of selfregulation of behavior – “Planning” (p < .05), “Evaluation of results” (p < .05), “Flexibility” (p < .05), “Independence” (p < .05) were clarified. It proves that awareness of physical culture as a value influences volitional qualities of students’ personality and their level of aspiration for success. It is established that students’ attitude to physical culture as a value is an effective factor in the formation of a healthy lifestyle, intellectual abilities, their own “Self”, as well as professionally important qualities.",

        "abstract": "Context. The article discusses the issues of increasing the accuracy of automatic control of a moving object using a mathematical model of a meter and a device observing measurement errors in the on-board controller of the control system. The object of the research is the processes of automatic control of a moving object with a mathematical model of a meter and a device observing measurement errors in the on-board controller of the control system. The subject of the research is a method and algorithms for increasing the accuracy of automatic control of a moving object with a mathematical model of a meter and a device observing measurement errors in the on-board controller of the control system. Objective. The aim of research is an improving the accuracy of automatic control of a moving object. Method. This aim is achieved through the use in the on-board controller of the control system of the mathematical meter model and the observing device built on its basis, the estimation of the useful component and the systematic error, depending on the motion parameters of the controlled object, using only the useful component for control, without systematic error. Results. A method and algorithms for increasing the control accuracy of a moving object through the use in the on-board controller of a mathematical meter model and an observer of systematic measurement errors, built on its basis, have been developed. The efficiency and effectiveness of the developed method and algorithms were confirmed by mathematical modeling in the MATLAB environment of the control processes of a moving object in a closed circuit with a control system. Conclusions. The results of mathematical modeling confirmed the operability and efficiency of the proposed method and algorithms and allow them to be used for practical purposes in the development of mathematical support for high – precision automatic control systems.",

        "title": "Personality Factors of Choosing Adaptation Strategies in a Different Cultural Environment by Labor Migrants from Ukraine",
        "abstract": "The paper presents empirical research on personality factors of choosing adaptation strategies in a different cultural environment by labor migrants. The study determines three major adaptation strategies: integration, assimilation and marginalization. It establishes that integration and assimilation are means of solving the crisis of social identity. Personal identity acquires features of mature positive identity, when labor migrants integrate into a different cultural environment of a country of their employment. If a migrant chooses the strategy of assimilation, then personal identity has a tendency to approach to diffusive, “fuzzy” identity with indefinite life cycles, a decreased level of self-respect, a lack of internal integrity and uniformity. A marginal status of labor migrants in a country of employment causes an intensification of the crisis of personal identity, when migrants are not satisfied with the situation of employment abroad, but they do not see opportunities for selfrealization in Ukraine. Factor analysis made it possible to establish an adaptation structure of Анотація Емпірично досліджено особистісні чинники вибору трудовими мігрантами стратегій адаптації в інокультурному просторі. З’ясовано три основних стратегії адаптації: інтеграція, асиміляція, маргіналізація. Встановлено, що інтеграція та асиміляція є засобом розв’язання кризи соціальної ідентичності. Особистісна ідентичність набуває ознак зрілої позитивної, коли трудовий мігрант інтегрується до інокультурного простору країни працевлаштування. Якщо мігрант обирає стратегію асиміляції, то особистісна ідентичність має тенденцію наближуватись до дифузної, “розмитої” ідентичності з невизначеними життєвими цілями, зниженим рівнем самоповаги, відсутністю внутрішньої цілісності та узгодженості. Маргінальне становище трудового мігранта у країні працевлаштування призводить до поглиблення кризи особистісної ідентичності, коли мігранта не влаштовує 13 Doctor of Psychological Sciences, Full Professor of Department of General and Social Psychology, Kherson State University, Kherson, Ukraine. 14 Doctor of Psychological Sciences, Full Professor of Department of General and Social Psychology, Kherson State University, Kherson, Ukraine. 15 Candidate of Pedagogical Sciences, Associate Professor of Department of Pedagogy, Eastern European National University named after Lesia Ukrainka, Lutsk, Ukraine 16 Candidate of Psychological Sciences, Associate Professor of Department Social Psychology and Social Work, Volodymyr Dahl East Ukrainian National University, Severodonetsk, Ukraine. 17 Graduate student, Department of General and Social Psychology Kherson State University, Kherson, Ukraine. 18 Doctor of Psychological Sciences, Professor of Department Differential and Special Psychology, Odessa I.

        "abstract": "Abstract One of the ways to reduce human influence on the control process is the development of automated and automatic control systems. Modern control systems are quite complex and require preliminary ground testing. The article considers the issues of creating Imitation Modelling Stand for such control system synthesis and testing. For this reason, a Control System Model was integrated into the local computer network of the navigation simulator NTPRO 5000. The authors of the paper developed and tested software for information exchange between the navigation simulator and the Control System Model. The authors also developed a functional module of collision avoidance with many targets for testing in a closed loop system with virtual training objects. The results showed that the developed Imitation Modelling Stand allowed developing and testing functional modules of the control systems. In comparison with the found analogues, it is easy to include in a closed simulation cycle various models of command devices, actuators, control objects, objects of training scene, weather conditions; it is universal both for solving problems of manual control and for developing and testing automatic and automated control systems; it is not highly specialised and is created at minimal costs.",

        "abstract": "Context. The article discusses approaches to anticipation identification being an essential part of the decision-making process done by the operator by using the example of a sea captain in ergatic systems of critical infrastructures in the sea transport management. The mentioned above aspect of anticipation of operators can be regarded as being a complex form of human-machine interaction and, certainly, claims for further elaboration of information and tools to be used. Objective. The way to approach development is taken as being based on an information analysis of the full range of trajectories of decision-making by operators at the time of performing complex multi-stage actions. These items are rooting out of their adopted strategy of human-machine interaction. Besides, it leads to the formation of a metric being able to algorithmically represent the enormous number of variants. It can be done taking into account conditions of combinatorial representation in terms of the geometric theory of groups on the Cayley graph. Method. Being a part of the approach elaboration the having been obtained during the analysis of the database of navigation simulators mathematical model of experimental data collecting and processing succeeded to be constructed. To confirm the formalalgorithmic approach a simulation was challenged to be carried out helping to form the trajectory of the operator’s decision making in critical situations. It was felicitously performed basing on the three-factor ERO-AEA-EAPI model. Thus, the algebraic and software representation of the metric decision space is noticed to uncover approximate complex human-machine interactions in uncertain environments. As a result, the converting process of data of the main subject of critical infrastructure (i.e. the operator) into knowledge is able to be coped with. In addition, factors possible to be gauged in the proposed metric are able to be uncovered. Results. In order to carry out the feasibility assessment of the developed approach as well as formal-algorithmic ones, an experiment was performed by using the Navi Trainer 5000 navigation simulator (NTPRO 5000). During having one of the most troublesome operations i.e. mooring we wanted the server data to be analyzed. As a result, data about anticipation being shaped as triangular constructs in the quasi-isometric space of Cayley graph is reported to have been obtained. The automated neural networks being used for result obtaining led to delivering of the possibility to get multiple data regression and to analyze the relationships of many independent variables. It is considered to be clear evidence due to having found out results of scattering and reliability diagrams. Conclusions. The having been presented in the investigations formal-algorithmic approach together with the developed software tools and the approaches of converting data into knowledge about operator anticipation are said to embrace the possibility to classify and to identify individual decision-making strategies when managing a vessel and to predict the likelihood of poor consequences. With regarding to the cogency of the proposed approach and models these issues happen to have been successfully justified by means of the automated processing of experimental data.",

        "abstract": "The article discusses the issues of mathematical support of the Information and Risk Control System for the offshore vessel operating in high risk areas near oil or gas platforms, other large moving objects. Vessels operating in high-risk areas are equipped with dynamic positioning systems and excessive control, which allows to increase the reliability, maneuverability and quality of control. Minimally excessive control structure with two stern Azimuth Control Devices (ACD) is considered. This structure is the last “frontier” to provide three-dimensional vessel control, therefore it is interesting in practical use. The control surfaces for this structure were built, their extreme values and level lines were analyzed. To dispensation redundancy, three control splitting algorithms were considered, analytical expressions for control splitting were obtained. There was carried out a comparative analysis of the considered splitting algorithms between themselves and the prototype according to the minimum Risk criterion. A comparative analysis showed that the splitting algorithm used in the prototype are special cases of the considered algorithms for dispensation redundancy. There were found controls that provide a “clean” rotation of the vessel without lateral force, which are not present in prototype. There were built control algorithms that provide complex vessel movements according to the minimum Risk criterion in automatic mode. Operability and efficiency of the algorithmic and software of the vessel control system operating in high risk areas, verified by mathematical modeling at imitation modeling stand.",

        "abstract": "This article discusses a formal analysis of time perception made by sea transport navigators being in critical situations while performing vessel navigation. The carried out analysis of experimental data and investigations of marine accidents provided us with valuable insights of having wide range of cases in which navigators, while performing complex maneuvers (i.e. mooring operation), are highly likely to be involved into facing challenges of getting poor time comprehension during template implementation process. It is worth mentioning that while having it this very issue is being influenced on by external and internal factors. It, for its part, is noticed to considerably contribute into the increased likelihood of accidents. The main goal of this study is reported to be the development of a concept of having formal and automated means and methods for the identification distortion of the navigator's time (DNT) as being an indicator of negative manifestation of human factor in critical situations. For the sake of having been able to accomplish this goal a generalized model for the formation of t DNT was proposed as well as mathematical models and automated tools were introduced to be used for DNT intervals identification when analyzing the physical trajectory of the vessel's movement. Besides, the generating individual time codes in emergency situations system is managed to be successfully revealed. Moreover, the carried out experiments using the certified navigation simulator NaviTrainer 5000 are said to have confirmed the convincing cogency and to have made clear evidences of providing practical value of the proposed approaches. It goes without saying that these issues are sure to significantly improve the safety-driven process of keeping a navigational watch while navigating a vessel.",

        "abstract": "The study examines the mental states of expecting a victory in men mini-football teams by means of content analysis (n=248) and factor analysis of mental states of expectations of sportsmen-footballers (n=128). The mental states of expecting a victory are important regulators of the sporting activity of its participants. The understanding of footballers’ mental states of expectations by their coaches affects the choice of the game guidelines and strategy, determines the content characteristics of tactical and technical training and operationalizes the training process of footballers. The purpose is to investigate the structure, variables and interdependence of the factors of footballers’ mental states of expecting a victory. Research methods: content analysis, tests with standardized questionnaires, factor analysis. Factor analysis was used to determine the structure of the mental states of expecting a victory. The main factor in this structure is F1 “value and sense self-regulation of a victory” (19.04%), correlated with F2 “pragmatic self-regulation of a victory” (rs=.424; p≤.01) and F3 “convergence of a victory” (rs=.362; p≤.01). The obtained results can be useful for coaches, sporting directors, for those dealing with training, for managers of mini-football and football clubs and also for the researchers in the area of psychology of physical education and sports.",

The need for communication is considered as a basic one in the development of an individual as a social subject of behavior. The study substantiates that interaction with others, emotional and confidential communication is a factor of personality development, the means of improving communicative competence. The research methods: tests with standardized questionnaires and factor analysis. The study examines communicative competence as an element of professional training of future language and literature teachers. Factor analysis was used to determine the structure of communicative competence of future language and literature teachers. The following factor structure was established: (85.54%): F1 “ Communicative intolerance ” (4.069; 23.94%), F2 “ Communicative dominance ” (2.491; 14.65%), F3 “ Communicative anxiety ” (2.219; 13.05%), F4 “ Ethno-social compromise ” (2.119; 12.47%), F5 “ Communicative Анотація Метою статті є емпіричне дослідження компонентів комунікативної компетентності майбутніх педагогів-філологів на етапі їхнього навчання в закладі вищої освіти. Потреба у спілкуванні розглянута як базова у розвитку людини як соціального суб’єкта поведінки. Обґрунтовано, що взаємодія з оточенням, емоційно-довірливе спілкування є чинником особистісного зростання, засобом формування комунікативної компетентності. Методи дослідження: тести зі стандартизованими анкетами та факторний аналіз. Емпірично досліджено комунікативну компетентність як елемент фахової підготовки майбутніх педагогів-філологів. Факторним аналізом визначено структура комунікативної компетентності майбутніх педагогів-філологів. Встановлено таку факторну структуру (85.54%): F1 “Комунікативна інтолерантність” (4.069; 23.94%), F2 “Комунікативна домінантність” (2.491; 14.65%), F3 “Комунікативна тривожність” (2.219; 13.05%), F4 “Етносоціальний компроміс” (2.119; 12.47%), F5 “Комунікативна безпорадність” (1.822; 10.72%), F6 “Потреба у спілкуванні” (1.820; 10.71%).

The research determines that in the structure of communicative competence of future language and literature teachers communicative tolerance reflects the need and content of communication and the willingness to communicate with others. The paper substantiates that a low level of communicative tolerance is an incentive for selfdevelopment in perceptive and interactive areas. It emphasizes that affiliation motivation is an important component of developing communicative tolerance at the stage of professional training at a higher education institution. The study shows that an individual’s need for affiliation during studies in a higher education institution is blocked by fear of rejection, causing different types of communicative intolerance.",

        "abstract": "Context. The article discusses the issues of increasing the accuracy of automatic control of a moving object using a mathematical model of a meter and a device observing measurement errors in the on-board controller of the control system. The object of the research is the processes of automatic control of a moving object with a mathematical model of a meter and a device observing measurement errors in the on-board controller of the control system. The subject of the research is a method and algorithms for increasing the accuracy of automatic control of a moving object with a mathematical model of a meter and a device observing measurement errors in the on-board controller of the control system. Objective. The aim of research is an improving the accuracy of automatic control of a moving object. Method. This aim is achieved through the use in the on-board controller of the control system of the mathematical meter model and the observing device built on its basis, the estimation of the useful component and the systematic error, depending on the motion parameters of the controlled object, using only the useful component for control, without systematic error. Results. A method and algorithms for increasing the control accuracy of a moving object through the use in the on-board controller of a mathematical meter model and an observer of systematic measurement errors, built on its basis, have been developed. The efficiency and effectiveness of the developed method and algorithms were confirmed by mathematical modeling in the MATLAB environment of the control processes of a moving object in a closed circuit with a control system. Conclusions. The results of mathematical modeling confirmed the operability and efficiency of the proposed method and algorithms and allow them to be used for practical purposes in the development of mathematical support for high – precision automatic control systems.",

        "abstract": ": The purpose of the article is to reveal the results of experimental study of the social expectations of holders of Master’s Degree in Pedagogy (Master of education / M.Ed.) (n=102). The psychological and pedagogical experiment was used in the study. The results are: significant positive changes in awareness indicator about the expected course of events (.004**; p≤.01); expected attitudes towards participants in interpersonal interaction (.008**; p≤.01); expected performance (.018**; p≤.01). The efficiency of the developed program was experimentally confirmed. The results of the study were presented at the IFNUL and KSU Masters and Teachers’ Reporting Conference. Participants noted that it would be very useful to find more factors that will help optimize the development of social expectations of masters of education, identify the most effective psycho-corrective practices, make the program prolonged and implement it in the educational process from the first year of study of masters, try to adapt it to higher education level – “Bachelor”. Experimental confirmation of the effectiveness of the developed program indicates the possibility and necessity of its implementation in the form of special course “Social Expectations of the Personality: Theory and Practice” in the educational process of masters of education. In the perspective of research, there is development and adaptation of optimization of development program and psychocorrection of social expectations for all bachelors and masters IFNUL",

        "abstract": "Context. There were considered the issues of improving the accuracy and reliability of automatic vessel motion control systems in conditions of large deviations in sensors measurements during maneuvering and failures of sensors and actuators. The object of research is the process of automatic vessel motion control in conditions of large deviations in sensors measurements during maneuvering and failures of sensors and actuators. The subject of research is a method and algorithms for improving the accuracy and reliability of automatic vessel motion control systems in conditions of large deviations in sensors measurements during maneuvering and failures of sensors and actuators. Objective. The aim of the research is development a method and algorithms for improving the accuracy and reliability of automatic vessel motion control systems in conditions of large deviations in sensors measurements during maneuvering and failures of sensors and actuators. Method. This goal is achieved by using in onboard controller of the automatic vessel motion control systems an observer to estimation the parameters of the state vector in the linear motion channel by measurements of linear speed and position sensors; estimation the parameters of the state vector in the angular motion channel by measurements of rotational speed and angular position sensors; continuous monitoring of the measured information by comparing it with the obtained estimations; correction estimations in the linear motion channel by measurements of linear speed and position sensors that have passed control; correction estimations in the angular motion channel by measurements of rotational speed and angular position sensors that have passed control; formation of a sensor failure in the linear motion channel (linear speed sensor or position sensor), if its measurements differ from the corresponding estimations for a greater than permissible value, to parry the failure in the linear motion channel by disconnecting the failed sensor from the observer and further estimation according to another sensor working in pairs; formation of a sensor failure in the angular motion channel (rotation speed sensor or angular position sensor), if its measurements differ from the corresponding estimations for a greater than permissible value, to parry the failure in the angular motion channel by disconnecting the failed sensor from the observer and further estimation according to another sensor working in pair; formation of an actuators failure in the linear motion channel (engine, automation or other device) if a simultaneous or sequential failure of both sensors were detected – linear speed sensor and position sensor, actuator failure alarm in the linear motion channel; formation of an actuators failure in the angular motion channel (rudders, drives, other devices) if a simultaneous or sequential failure of both sensors were detected – rotation speed sensor and angular position sensor, actuator failure alarm in the angular motion channel. This method and algorithms make it possible to improve the accuracy and reliability of automatic vessel motion control processes in conditions of large deviations in sensors measurements during maneuvering and failures of sensors and actuators. Results. The proposed method and algorithms for improving the accuracy and reliability of automatic vessel motion control systems in conditions of large deviations in sensors measurements during maneuvering and failures of sensors and actuators were verified by mathematical modeling in the MATLAB environment of the control object movement in a closed circuit with a control system for various types of vessels, navigation areas, weather conditions and cases of large deviations in sensors measurements during maneuvering and failures of sensors and actuators. Conclusions. The results of mathematical modeling confirmed the efficiency of the developed method and algorithms and allow to recommend them for practical use in the development of mathematical support for automatic vessel motion control systems in conditions of large deviations in sensors measurements during maneuvering and failures of sensors and actuators.",

        "abstract": "The article discusses the issues of identification of models of analysis of the navigational situation by the navigator during the passage in narrow places and port areas; this is especially relevant in critical situations. As part of the research, an analysis of literary sources was carried out, which made it possible to characterize this direction as actual for the development of special means of an experimental nature. As the main goal, the article presents formal-logical approaches to the development of software and hardware means for determining the areas of attention of the navigator as a subject of an ergatic system. A mechanism was determined for the formation the indexes of the analytical activities of the navigator during assessing the situation, mathematical models, and means for clarifying the position of the navigator on the navigation bridge. A geometric approximation of indexes was proposed, the metric of which can significantly reduce the identification time of critical situations and prevent negative consequences. The carried experiments by using the certified navigation simulator Navi Trainer 5000 confirmed the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed approaches, which will greatly improve the retraining of marine crew.",

        "title": "DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM OF PERCEPTION OF NAVIGATION DANGER WHEN IMPLEMENTATION COMPLICATED MANEUVERS",
        "abstract": "Context. The article focuses on the question of automated decision-making analysis made by the operator in ergatic systems of critical infrastructures on the example of marine transport control in difficult navigation conditions. It is evident enough that the main criterion for an adequate perception of input information done by an operator is highly likely to predict the choice of behavioral decision-making strategies in discrete time conditions. However, the difficulty of modeling the operator’s actions is found to be lying in non-linear pattern of taking definite decisions in emergency situations and deviations from the Codes and Rules. Objective. The research purpose strategy of conducted investigation can be defined as the development of the mathematical platform for a decision support system (DSS) module with an aim to identify the class-forming set of atomic elements. In particular this issue determines the fact of distortion of the perception of information about navigation risks predicting the operator’s behavior pattern while having vessel running process. This is possible to have it depicted through formal analysis. Method. To capture the analysis of danger perception by the operator the paper introduces a mathematical model of data collection which identifies the fact of perception distortion in the form of attribute space of metadata obtained by the method of converting information from navigation devices. Besides, the factor of disorientation of the operator can be considered to be a shift on a displaced bridge which significantly affects on the analysis of information for adequate decision making. In addition, taking into account the failure of navigation equipment such as: RADAR, ARPA, AIS, ECDIS, especially while doing exit from the automatic control mode, a dangerous precedent can possibly be created for the operator not ready to perceive the complexity of the situation. To make it work a formal analysis was carried out using the extending risks possibility level tasks during the transition under these conditions. In addition to this item, a probabilistic model of perceiving the situation under the conditions of the error set is reported to have been constructed. So, as the result, the modeling process turned out to show the definite evidence of getting no way possibility to have the degree of criticality of the navigation situation determined without a clear identification of factors affecting the distortion of perception of the operator. Nevertheless, generalized statistical data are sure to be not enough and there is a special need of taking into account an individual information model of each operator for the effective work of DSS as this process faces real challenges. It must be significantly noticed that in order to analyze the perception of information by the operator a special test for defining preferences when choosing a strategy of control actions in the form of maneuvering under difficult navigation conditions purpose was created. Regarding the test results, as well as data on the passage of locations, certain attention is advised to be drawn to the classification analysis of 15 parameters using artificial neural networks having been carried out by our team and, as a consequence, the boundaries of deviations in the perception of navigational danger were found out and clarified. Additional superior item to be spoken about is certainly the introduction of rules and algorithms having been welcomed into the DSS core including the following: interaction field, RADAR and NIS synchronization tools; actual navigational hazard in a given cartographic area; ships trajectories and, as a result, simulations of probable deviations in the information perception of the operator. Results. In order to meet beneficial agreement between the effectiveness of the developed DSS with the proposed formalanalytical approaches an experiment was assumed to be appropriate to be conducted using the Navi Trainer 5000 navigation simulator (NTPRO 5000). Based on the foregoing, due to comprehensive results in experiment metadata for the 2.5 years of operation of navigation simulators and DSS software tools the identification of the deviation probabilities in the information perception of dangers was achieved and export the predicted data to new locations for the operator and cartographic areas was performed. Undoubtedly, the experimental investigation confirmed the hypothesis of the study and reflected completely the feasibility of using this DSS to make predictions of possible risks when control the vessel by analyzing the information model of the operator. Conclusions. Formal-analytical approaches presented in the study combined with the developed DSS software tools and the information itself made it possible to classify the decision-making strategies of the operator when control the vessel and to predict the probability of catastrophic consequences. The feasibility of the proposed models and methods was successfully revealed by carried out experiments.",

        "abstract": "The article discusses the issues of automatic control of the vessel’s movement using excessive control, which allows to organize the movement of the vessel without a drift angle, to reduce the hydrodynamic resistance and fuel consumption. Issues of reducing energy consumption and fuel economy on board, as well as related issues of reducing emissions and improving the environment are especially relevant at the present time. A brief review of literature devoted to improving the energy efficiency of ships was carried out. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the issues of improving energy efficiency are solved in various ways, for example, constructively, by reducing weight, hydrodynamic and aerodynamic drag of the hull, using a sail, creating more advanced power plants, however, the authors have not found methods and algorithms for reducing hydrodynamic drag and fuel consumption through the use of excessive control. It is concluded that the development of such systems is relevant. Mathematical, algorithmic, and software have been developed for an onboard controller simulator of a vessel’s motion control system with excessive control, the operability and efficiency of which has been verified by numerical simulation in a closed circuit with a mathematical model of the control object for various types of vessels, navigation areas and weather conditions. The experiments have confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the developed method, algorithmic and software, and allow us to recommend them for practical use in the development of mathematical support for vessel control systems with excessive control.",

A Four-factor structure of sensory regulation (67.139%) was formed: F1, “Value-sensory evaluation of the situation” (31.774%), F2, “Super situationality of evaluation” (18.936%), F3, “Reducing the emotional situation” (9.536%) and F4, “Positive understanding of the situation” (6.893%). Understanding the structure of sensory regulation will help future teachers to control their mental state in a situation of uncertainty.",

Experiments have been carried out confirming the problem of the negative influence of the human factor on the example of navigational tasks in the Bosphorus and Hong Kong Straits. Automated tools have been developed to identify hazardous areas for navigation on location mapping by analyzing the accident geolocation in the Hong Kong Strait and the Bosphorus, which is a decision support system for emergency situations. A software module has been developed that makes it possible to identify the time periods for the manifestation of the human factor of the navigator by analyzing the ECDIS database in real time. Mathematical models of the triggering of the vessel automated course alteration system (VACA) and the actions of the navigator when controlling/navigating the vessel in difficult maneuvering zones are proposed.",

        "abstract": "The article analyzes social expectations of future social psychologists, examines the results of research on the peculiarities of social expectations, and establishes psycholinguistic determinants of constructing social reality by personality. \nIt is emphasized that the variability of the demands of social environment predetermines the need for constant prognostic activity of the subject of life activity, not only in relation to natural object relations, but also in the sphere of social interaction, social communication, and speech constructing practices in the form of peculiar social expectations. \nIt is substantiated and proven that the strict quantification of texts, creation of a coding matrix, quantitative and qualitative content analysis, the empirical distribution of scales at all levels of the investigated parameters, the determination of correlation, ensure reliability, reliability and validity of the research of the psycholinguistic aspect of the social expectations of future social psychologists. \nIt is established that the future social psychologists by the properties of social expectations showed such indices: internality (51.43%), not contradicting the results obtained by other researchers; activity (57.13%), the results of which almost coincide with the internality by the quantitative and percentage values; moderate results of openness (47.52%), which may indicate maturity and social competence of one part of the subjects and at the same time inability or unwillingness to interpret, outline their expectations – the second part of the subjects. \nIt is proved that future social psychologists, interpreting the social field – define it, pay great attention to reflective aspects, take the position of «participant in the process». \nIt is noted that taking into account the age-related, interesting features of the sample objectively reflected the measurement of the properties of the expected social reality and indicated the quantitative and qualitative psychological parameters of the social expectations of personality. It is proved that the content analysis allows measuring human behavior. It is shown how the sign-semantic formations acquire subjective meanings, become objective factuality, that influence the construction of the social reality by the personality.",

Was made a brief review of literature devoted to the problem of collision avoidance and conclusion was drown on the relevance of developing such systems. There were developed mathematical and algorithmic support of the combined collision avoidance with many targets, including maneuvering ones. Based on the synthesized algorithms, there was developed software in the MATLAB environment for a simulator of an onboard controller of a ship control system, the operability and efficiency of mathematical, algorithmic and software was tested in a closed circuit with a Navi Trainer 5000 navigation simulator for various types of ships, navigation areas and weather conditions. The experiments confirmed the efficiency of the proposed method and algorithms and allow to recommend them for practical use in the development of modules for automatic collision avoidance with many targets, including maneuvering ones, an onboard controller of the ship’s control system.",

        "abstract": "Purpose. To analyse the philosophical and psychological contexts of social expectations of personality, to form general scientific provisions, to reveal the properties, patterns of formation, development and functioning of social expectations as a process, result of reflection and construction of social reality. Theoretical basis of the study is based on the phenomenology of E. Husserl, the social constructivism philosophy of L. S. Vygotskiy, P. Berger, T. Luckmann, K. J. Gergen, ideas of constructive alternativeism of G. Kelly, psychology of social expectations of a personality as the unity of the mental process, mental state and properties of expectations. Originality. Social expectations of personality are considered as philosophical and psychological dimensions of the study, presented by analysing expectations in social constructivism, externalizing, building a model of the expected future. The authors clarified some theoretical and methodological aspects of the study of patterns of social expectations in the reflection and construction of social reality. The role of social institutions in the formation of expectations is outlined. The poly-aspect of the investigated problems is shown. It is substantiated that formation, realization of social expectations in organization of interaction of personality and social environment is possible in the presence of subject, object and content of activity. Conclusions. Social expectations influence social behaviour and determine the behaviour of an individual, small contact group, community, or large mass of people. Social expectations are able to set specific requirements, norms, sanctions, ideals that participants of the process must follow or must not violate. The philosophical dimension of the study integrates the ontological, epistemological, axiological preconditions for the formation and realization of the social ideal, represented by the study of the expected future in the forms of utopia, eschatology and thanatology. Psychological dimension of the study has a sufficiently developed content orientation from the psychological content parameters of social expectations to the role of expectations in social institutions and various spheres of human life. Systematic, actionable, self-regulatory, and subjective approaches have constituted a verified system of interpreting the social expectations of personality as a process, a result of the reflection and construction of social reality. The topic of social expectations of personality is far from being completed, in our opinion it is promising to create a deeper philosophical concept of social expectations of the personality. The specific topics are of particular relevance in the context of socio-political uncertainty, domination of the mass consciousness, loss of national and cultural identity.",

        "abstract": "У статті висвітлено результати дослідження мотиваційних психічних станів військовослужбовців, які брали участь у бойових діях. Глибинну сутність мотиваційних психічних станів військовослужбовців доцільно вивчити саме в професійній діяльності, у контексті виконання значущих завдань. Дослідження мотиваційних психічних станів військовослужбовців, які є учасниками бойових дій, спонукає відшукати взаємозв’язки, закономірності, детермінанти, що у свою чергу дає можливість вести мову про суттєвий науковий вклад в психологію мотивації особистості військовослужбовця.\nМета статті полягає у вивченні мотиваційних психічних станів військовослужбовців; емпіричному дослідженні структури та взаємозв’язків мотиваційних психічних станів військовослужбовців, що брали участь у бойових діях.\nЕмпіричні методи дослідження: опитувальник «Рівень домагань особистості» («РДО») (Гербачевський, 1990), методика діагностики особистості на мотивацію до успіху (Елерс, 1974), копінг-тест (Лазарус, Фолкман, 1988, адаптація Крюкова, Куфтяк, Замишляєва, 2004). Підібраним комплексом методик та методів статистичної обробки даних якісно інтерпретовано мотиваційні психічні стани, відокремлено один стан від іншого, окреслено змістові особливості. Факторним аналізом визначено структуру мотиваційних психічних станів військовослужбовців. Встановлено, що найважливішою складовою є F4 «прагматичне мотивування», яке має найбільше взаємозв’язків, і найбільш значущим (p≤0,01) є співвідношення F4 та F1 (0,344). Обґрунтовано, що структура, змінні і взаємозалежність факторів мотиваційних психічних станів є важливими складовими у вирішенні завдань професійної, службової (бойової) діяльності військовослужбовців. Результати дослідження можуть бути цікаві керівникам військових підрозділів, командно-офіцерському складу, керівникам військових навчальних закладів, а також дослідникам у галузі військової психології, психології мотивації особистості.",

The understanding of mental states of expectations by education workers allows operationalizing the process of solving tasks of students’ academic and professional training. The purpose is to examine the structure, variables and interdependence of the factors of students’ mental states of expectations. The research methods are content-analysis, tests with standardized questionnaires, factor analysis. Factor analysis was used to determine the structure of mental states of expectations. The principal factor in this structure is F1“meaning-of-life moderation” (20.70%), which is interrelated with F2 “pragmatic regulation” (rs=.404; p≤.01) and F3 “subjective regulation” (rs=.357; p≤.01). The obtained results could be useful for education directors organizing the academic process of students, and also for scientists in the field of psychology of expectations, psychology of constructing the future.",

It was determined that the students are guided by higher salaries and wages abroad and new experience, in this situation the evaluation of occupational prestige and the possibility to increase social status are rather insignificant. That leads to the students’ understanding of the Ukrainians’ labor migration as a necessary measure, which is caused by the necessity to meet an individual’s basic needs.",

        "abstract": "Purpose. To analyse the philosophical and psychological contexts of social expectations of personality, to form general scientific provisions, to reveal the properties, patterns of formation, development and functioning of social expectations as a process, result of reflection and construction of social reality. Theoretical basis of the study is based on the phenomenology of E. Husserl, the social constructivism philosophy of L. S. Vygotskiy, P. Berger, T. Luckmann, K. J. Gergen, ideas of constructive alternativeism of G. Kelly, psychology of social expectations of a personality as the unity of the mental process, mental state and properties of expectations. Originality. Social expectations of personality are considered as philosophical and psychological dimensions of the study, presented by analysing expectations in social constructivism, externalizing, building a model of the expected future. The authors clarified some theoretical and methodological aspects of the study of patterns of social expectations in the reflection and construction of social reality. The role of social institutions in the formation of expectations is outlined. The poly-aspect of the investigated problems is shown. It is substantiated that formation, realization of social expectations in organization of interaction of personality and social environment is possible in the presence of subject, object and content of activity. Conclusions. Social expectations influence social behaviour and determine the behaviour of an individual, small contact group, community, or large mass of people. Social expectations are able to set specific requirements, norms, sanctions, ideals that participants of the process must follow or must not violate. The philosophical dimension of the study integrates the ontological, epistemological, axiological preconditions for the formation and realization of the social ideal, represented by the study of the expected future in the forms of utopia, eschatology and thanatology. Psychological dimension of the study has a sufficiently developed content orientation from the psychological content parameters of social expectations to the role of expectations in social institutions and various spheres of human life. Systematic, actionable, self-regulatory, and subjective approaches have constituted a verified system of interpreting the social expectations of personality as a process, a result of the reflection and construction of social reality.

        "abstract": "The article presents the full cycle from development and implementation to the complete coverage and analysis of the results of the program of optimization of the development and psychocorrection of social expectations of personality, by an example of the project «Leader’s School» for the first time. A retrospective and comparative analysis of the project implementation experience is presented. The essence of stages of program development is revealed, psychological content parameters of social expectations of personality are investigated. A considerable amount of psychological content parameters, related to the motivational structure of the personality, sense of life orientations, subject control and exspectometric features has been analyzed. The program has been implemented, which has contributed to the positive dynamic changes in cognitive and behavioral readiness for the intended course of events, which in turn allowed the participants of the project group to be able to assess the future perspective, comprehend the content and organizational peculiarities of future professional activity, «take on the role of future work», which made adjustments to social expectations of the subjects, and affected the design of the expected future model. It was assumed that a significant proportion of students turned out to be unprepared to rapidly change their status, which was reflected on the level of social psychological peculiarities of the expected attitude of the individual towards participants in interpersonal interaction (Tp=16,00; Tn=44,00; p≥0,05). It is established that the process of formation of emotional readiness requires long-term external interventions. \nThe author’s position is that the developed program for optimization of development and psychocorrection of social expectations of personality has become an effective, guided tool for solving a number of important social economic problems of the present, which lie in the sphere of interaction «institution of higher education – professional activity».",
