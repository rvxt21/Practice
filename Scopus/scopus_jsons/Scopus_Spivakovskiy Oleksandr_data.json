      "description": "This study aims to generalize and systematize the experience of Kherson State University (Ukraine) in times of war under temporary russian occupation of Kherson city and the university displacement. All these factors have designed new practices of management and strategic development. The key issues of stability and resistance to the challenges of war of the university’s community are rethinking the university strategy and the solidarity of national and international academic institutions, local city and state government, civil society, and businesses. The study shows that the primary mechanism of university functioning in occupation and displacement is total digitization of all processes and enhanced social communication of the university community (e.g., transition from partial to total digital document turnover and active use of social media and internet communications in the strategy of crisis communication and university’s community support). Speed-up of digital transformations and distance educational technologies of teaching in synchronous and asynchronous formats (in conditions of unstable internet connection and energy supply) ensured the high quality of the educational process. The personal values of university students and staff (resistance to the invaders (occupants), rejection of collaboration, and volunteer activities) and results of the enrolment campaign in 2022 (1037 entrants) demonstrate the benefits of perennial university activities in the context of national identity development. These also highlight perspectives of the university to form the human capital of Kherson region in general and intellectual elite in particular.",

      "description": "Creating a system of complex disease diagnosis based on gene expression data using modern data mining and machine learning techniques is one of the topical areas of recent bioinformatics. The main problem in this subject area consists of a large volume of experimental data; each investigated object contains approximately 20000 genes. In this paper, we propose the technique of both formation and analysis of gene expression data based on the joint use of various computational and intelligent methods of complex data processing. As the experimental data, we use the gene expression data of patients who were investigated for various types of cancer diseases. Initially, the data was formed and analyzed using the functions and modules of TCGAbiolinks and Bioconductor packages. Then, the non-informative genes in terms of both the statistical and entropy criteria were removed from the initial database. To identify the level of significance of gene expression profiles, we have applied the general Harrington desirability index, which contains, as the components, transformed statistical and entropies criteria. Finally, we applied the random forest classifier and convolutional neural network with the calculation of various types of classification quality criteria for the binary and multi-classification of the investigated objects in the first and the second cases, respectively. Analyzing the simulation results has shown that the identification accuracy of the examined samples is high in all cases. To our mind, the proposed technique creates the basis for improving complex disease diagnosis systems based on gene expression data.",

      "description": "In this paper, we present the model of assessment of higher education school academic staff members rating based on the complex use of Harrington’s desirability function and a fuzzy inference system. Four main directions of activity were evaluated within the framework of the proposed model: pedagogical activity; science and research; organization activity and other activity types. Each of the proposed types of activities was assessed separately using the Harrington desirability function based on prior determined scores, where the general activity index of the appropriate score was calculated as the weighted average of the private desirability values. The Mamdani inference algorithm with triangular and trapezoidal membership functions was used within the framework of the fuzzy inference process implementation to evaluate the general rating score of the appropriate academic staff member. The base of rules was proposed to form the output for general rating scores calculated based on the individual rating scores. The output of the system was presented for each of the appropriate activity types separately and based on the assessment of the general rating score that contained the separate rating scores as the components. To our best mind, the proposed model can help us to optimize the functional possibilities of higher school system operation.",

      "description": "The views of scientists on the problem of the generational theory in the field of higher education and science are presented. The use of tools for measuring teachers' performance on the example of international scientometric databases and local systems for automated determination of performance results is presented, the prospects of its scalability in higher education institutions is proved. The dependence of the rating indicators of teachers' performance on the age of scientific and pedagogical workers is experimentally studied. The generational balance of teachers of higher education institutions is studied on the basis of the analysis of the ratio of age and publication activity of the most productive TOP teachers of universities occupying different positions of the consolidated ranking. A SWOT analysis of the generational balance of teachers of higher education institutions was conducted. The tendency of decrease of the percentage of young scientists among university teachers is revealed, the possible consequences are analyzed. The mechanisms of application of tools for measuring the university teachers' performance depending on the age category are described. The imbalance of different age groups of teachers indicates high risks of a generational conflict and may lead to a reduction of performance efficiency in the future. Performance measurement tools are an important factor for the implementation of educational management of higher education institution.",

Implementation of the IMOC technique assumes division of the initial dataset into two similar subsets contained the same number of pairwise similar objects at the first step of this procedure implementation. Then, we have executed the data clustering on the obtained subsets concurrently within the range of the appropriate algorithm parameters variation with estimation of various types of clustering quality criteria (internal (IQC) and external (EQC)) at each step of this procedure implementation. The final solution concerning algorithm optimal parameters determination was made based on the maximum values of the complex balance criterion (CBC) which contains both the ICQ and ECQ as the components. The analysis of the simulation results has allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of both the internal and external clustering quality criteria to determine the optimal parameters of clustering algorithm using various type of data. To our mind, the obtained results can allow us to increase the clustering procedure exactness and to decrease the reproducibility error.",

      "description": "Nowadays ICT are one of main ways to arrange and create effective tools for organizing the interaction and processing large amount of information. In our opinion, information of university’s scientific activity should be presented in the rating form, which gives an opportunity to analyze development in different directions and changes. The key idea of the article is presenting of our experience in developing rating system for universities based on scientist's scientometric indices. The system provides open data from different scientometric systems, such as Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science and Semantic Scholar. The possibility of automatical construction of a rating of scientists, research groups and organizations (as well as their structural subdivisions) is described.",

For teachers it is reasonable to allocate two basic approach of ICT use: e-learning courses designing (to satisfaction of educational needs of students and implementation of new educational approaches) and openness in the presentation of their own research interests. For effective implementation of these approaches it requires information and educational environment of the university and special training of teachers. The model of informational and educational environment of Kherson State University, which is regarded as a set of processes and activities is presented in the article. The curriculum of advanced training course for teachers of the University was designed; the successful completion will allow teachers effectively use ICT to solve professional tasks in educational and research activities.

      "description": "The article shows the transformation of modern didactic model into three-subject one (Student - Teacher - Information and communication pedagogical environment). The new subject's active components that are the most evident in learning process are analyzed. The requirements set to the information and communication pedagogical environment as an educational subject is described. The comparative characteristic of traditional and innovative teaching system components is presented. The authors have made the comparative description of the main university studies forms in different didactic models: object-subject, subject-subject and three-subject training. The experience of the information and communication pedagogical environment creating in the University is described. It is carried out the comparative subjects' behavior modeling during different training forms according to subject-subject or three-subject didactic system. The measurement of each three educational subjects' cogency and their significance in the process of major study operations (collection, processing, storage, transmission) during various training forms as lecture, practice and individual work is presented. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.",

      "description": "This chapter focuses on analyzing the structure of a university as a corporation - a complex organizational and functional mechanism which serves educational interests. It suggests that looking at a university as a specific business corporation helps better understand, more accurately plan, and seamlessly implement the transformation of a university towards better meeting the requirements of academic reform and the society at large. It is demonstrated that managing a university as a corporation is more complex compared to conventional business because of bigger diversity of different aspects and facets to be regarded in a balanced and harmonized way. A conclusion is drawn that an Information Technology and Analytics infrastructure is imperative as an instrument for managing a university at all levels. Finally the evidence is given of a successful trial of this management model and approach in real world settings at Kherson State University during the last several years - in particular for training professionals in our Computer Science and IT programme. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",
