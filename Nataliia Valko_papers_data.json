        "abstract": "Changes in society related to the development of science, technology, computing power, cloud services, artificial intelligence, increasing general access to huge amounts of open data, lead to increased global investment in technology and services. Appropriate training is required by specialists to create a workforce to work with artificial intelligence. On the one hand, it puts forward new requirements for the training of young people, and educational content, on the other hand, provides opportunities for the use of cloud technologies during the educational process. Widespread use of AI in various fields and everyday life poses the task of understanding the basic terms related to Artificial intelligence (AI), such as Machine learning (ML), Neural network (NN), Artificial neural networks (ANN), Deep Learning, Data Science, Big Data, mastering the basic skills of using and understanding the AI principles, which is possible during the study in the school course of computer science. Cloud technologies allow you to use the power of a remote server (open information systems, digital resources, software, etc.) regardless of the location of the consumer and provide ample opportunities for the study of artificial intelligence. In this article we reveal the possibilities of cloud technologies as a means of studying artificial intelligence at school, consider the need for three stages of training and provide development of tasks and own experience of using cloud technologies to study artificial intelligence on the example of DALL-E, Google QuickDraw, cloud technologies Makeblock, PictoBlox, Teachable Machine at different stages of AI study.",

        "abstract": "One of the most effective ways to implement STEM education in full secondary education is through research activities. It is implemented by performing certain projects. Professional activity of teachers of natural and mathematical disciplines in STEM education is aimed at the students’ mental, cognitive, and personal qualities formation and development. Their level determines the possibility of further mastering by students of a promising specialty STEM industry. It also involves the formation of the ability and willingness to solve complex problems, which is possible with the appropriate level of critical thinking, creativity, cognitive flexibility, teamwork, as well as the ability to implement research activities. In article determines the nature of the relationship between disciplines and the degree of integration. The place of project activity on robotics in school training is considered, describes the competencies that are formed as a result of such project activities. the possibility of teaching robotics to future teachers within the framework of existing curricula is also considered. The concept of STEM education has a broad interpretation: from a simple list of “exact” or “engineering” disciplines to inventive activity. In Ukraine, this area has become synonymous with scientific and research work: research and experiments. From this point of view, robotics is an effective means of developing STEM education. But this is a new tool and schools have a low level of interest in its study. Therefore, our article focuses on finding opportunities to implement the basics of robotics in education. The article formulated course requirements in accordance with the educational needs of the future teachers of science, mathematics and the level of technology development. The paper presents an example of project implementation in robotics, describes the stages of its implementation and achieved educational results.",

        "abstract": "The article examines the impact of market requirements on the educational system, technological development of society and changes in the economic development of the country. The main directions of changes in European educational policy and their formalization in the framework of competences have been reviewed. The considered practices of organizing educational space in Ukraine and other countries allowed determining the structure of the interaction of participants in the educational environment of STEM-oriented training: administrative and managerial component, cooperation between education and business structures, scientific and methodological support, technological factor, popularization and human factor. The article gives a definition of the educational environment of STEM-oriented learning. According to each of the points of this structure, the peculiarities of their implementation in Ukraine have been presented: steps to implementation at legislative level have been taken, a list of measures aimed at popularizing and supporting STEM-education has been developed, a way of the dissemination of these ideas has been outlined and the list of already existing developments and implementation practices has been made. The conditions required for the development of educational STEM-environment have been defined. The article presents the model of the educational environment of STEM-oriented learning developed at the STEM-school of Kherson State University. The description of the project activity of the teacher and students in the context of the creation of educational environment of STEM-oriented learning is given. Also, the article offers examples of interdisciplinary projects. Their implementation requires that the teacher have a good theoretical foundation in mathematics, physics, technology and programming.",

        "abstract": "Cloud technologies being used in STEM education for providing robotics studying are highlighted in this article. Developing cloud robotic systems have not been used to their fullest degree in education but are applied by limited specialists’ number. Advantages given by cloud robotics (an access to big data, open systems, open environments development) lead to work with mentioned systems interfaces improving and having them more accessible. The potential represented by these technologies make them worth being shown to the majority of teachers. Benefits of cloud technologies for robotics and automatization systems are defined. An integrated approach to knowledge assimilation is STEM education basis. The demanded stages for robotics system development are shown and cloud sources which could be possibly used are analyzed in this article.",

        "abstract": "The specialized training influence to the choice of further direction of study is considered in the work. The assumption that early involvement of students in the study of natural and mathematical disciplines, in particular mathematics is given. It will stimulate young people to get STEM education in future. The essential element in future professional choice, development and formation is the issue of motivation for learning. It is important that modern students are gradually losing their incentive to study. Almost a third of those who choose the appropriate study profile have contradictions between professional self-determination and the availability of the necessary knowledge for the profession, between choosing a higher education institution and being able to enter in it. The contradiction requires purposeful formation of a conscious choice of future activities. The conducted research has shown that the basis of the motivational component of the choice of STEM-learning is studying of natural and mathematical disciplines by modern teaching technologies and organizing of additional lessons system based on the projected teaching methods. It satisfies the growing needs for intelligence, knowledge, motivational beliefs to understand the specifics of the future profession.",

The main purpose of it is to achieve a significant level of individualization of the educational process, taking into account the individual characteristics and capabilities of each participant of the process. The implementation of the approach became possible at using elements of the theory of artificial neural networks in the educational process. Based on the network, it is possible to build a model of the educational process; it will significantly increase the control of the teacher on the educational process. Moreover, this network can adapt to a specific education task, the individual characteristics of the student and teacher. The mathematical model of the educational process using modern information technologies and neural networks is constructed. Their use is based on the developed criteria of successful execution of various stages of the educational process. Such criteria are designed for both the student and the teacher. The characteristic of participant’s activity of the educational process is considered in the work. A numerical interpretation of this concept is proposed.",

Одной из таких задач является создание транспорта с автономным управлением. В статье рассмотрен пример построения модели транспорта автономного движения на базе платы Arduino. Модель работает под управлением датчиков освещенности. Было проведено эмпирическое исследование понятия автономности транспортных средств: сбор информации о различных реализациях автономного движения и системах, которые его поддерживают; разработка вариантов реализации автономного движения с использованием различных аппаратных средств; экспериментальная проверка гипотез о пригодности того или иного варианта системы автономного управления; тестирование и оценка работы транспортного средства.",

        "abstract": "Today, specialists in engineering specialties are becoming increasingly popular on the labor market. In accordance with the requirements of society, the educational system is looking for opportunities to increase children's interest in the study of subjects in the natural and mathematical cycle. The article presents the experience of holding a summer camp for children for the purpose of attracting them to scientific research and acquaintance with the courses of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). The teachers of the STEM-school of the Kherson State University developed the \"Summer Intensive\" course to familiarize children with the basics of robotics, programming and physics. The course is designed for five days, each of which includes 4 lessons: from physics in practice and experiments, the basics of robotics, the basics of programming, needlework, as well as active games, walks in the park, excursions. During two years 188 children were trained, the article contains the justification for the selection of experiments in physics for children 6-14 years old, a detailed description of their conduct, organization of acquaintance with the basics of robotics using Lego Education WeDo 2.0, programming with Scratch. Particular attention is paid to the peculiarities of the organization and the generalization of the results of training in the summer camp in general and in the context of each subject.",

        "abstract": "There are a number of Eastern states, in which there is a significant economic growth and thestrengthening of the position of world leaders in technology. According to the results of the internationalassessment of PISA students, these countries also lead the ranking of educational system ratings. Therefore,the education systems of such states are of interest for research. A critical study of existing solutions for theimplementation and popularization of STEM-education can be useful for building our own STEM-educationsystem. It will also offer an opportunity to identify various options for improving the competitiveness of our state. The article provides an overview of the existing educational research in China, Japan, Taiwan,Singapore, and Australia. An overview of the existing regulatory framework and the system of teachereducation in these countries has also been made. Although each country defines in its own way a set ofSTEM-objects and their combinations, in most cases mathematics, science (physics, biology, chemistry) andICT (digital technologies) take the basis. Emphasis is placed on the system of teacher education (graduateand postgraduate) in mathematical and natural disciplines. There are also examples of initiatives launched bynon-state institutions involved in teacher development.",

        "abstract": "The development of artificial intelligence systems in the near future will lead to a reduction in routine, template work. The toolkit changes in most professions. There is a need for a quick retraining of a specialist and the use of computer systems. Nowadays, separate devices and systems have been created that can solve some of the problems that appear in everyday life. Therefore, STEM education is one of the directions that is in demand in society. During last few years in Ukraine there has been a rapid increase in the number of technical groups robotics and programming. All of them are new form of organization, types of classes, target audience. We made an effort to summarize the information received on this issue. In this article we analyze the situation on the market of educational services of the STEM-direction in Ukraine and in other countries, consider the existing technical and methodological support of STEM-education, as well as the experience of creating a STEM-school based on the post-graduate education center of Kherson State University. We describe the steps needed to create such a structure, its place in the educational system. Also we describe the experience of developing the material for the development of curricula, a series of events that promote the attraction of researches, and the introduction of digital technologies in the educational process.",
